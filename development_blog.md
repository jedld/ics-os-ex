### 16:35 — xHCI BAR mapping above 4 GiB

**Current problem:** the xHCI backend rejects controller BARs above the low
4 GiB identity map, a common firmware resource placement on modern laptops.

**Activity completed:** added a bounded kernel-only MMIO window at
`KMMIO_BASE`, shared by the kernel mapping and available to process page
tables, and routed xHCI BAR access through `mmio_map()`. Low MMIO continues to
use the identity-map UC path, while high MMIO uses a locked, TLB-shootdown
protected kernel mapping. A q35 test relocates QEMU's xHCI BAR above 4 GiB
before enumeration and then requires the normal USB-root, cache-sync, guest
copy, and host byte-comparison oracle to pass.

**QA delivered:** `make test-usb-storage-xhci`,
`make test-usb-storage-xhci-high-bar`, and `make test-usb-storage` pass.
The high-BAR test asserts the relocated BAR and rejects TLB-shootdown failures.

### 16:30 — ext4 host e2fsck validation
**Current problem:** `make test-ext4` passed in QEMU, but host `e2fsck` still
reported block/inode bitmap padding errors and ignored bitmap checksum
mismatches on the post-test image.

**Activity completed:** compared the post-test image with a fresh `mkfs.ext4`
image and traced e2fsprogs 1.47 bitmap handling in `rw_bitmaps.c`, `csum.c`, and
`pass5.c`. The bitmap checksum is stored only in the group descriptor; the
bitmap block tail, including the final four bytes, must remain `0xff` padding.
The GDT block-bitmap checksum is CRC32C over the full block bitmap using the
UUID seed, and the GDT inode-bitmap checksum is CRC32C over only
`inodes_per_group / 8` bytes, with no group-number prefix. Fixed the ext4
driver's block/inode set/free paths to stop writing a CRC into the bitmap tail
and to compute the GDT checksums using e2fsprogs' exact ranges. Removed the
temporary ext4/virtio/pcache debug prints.

**QA delivered:** `make test-ext4` now runs the QEMU guest test and then
mandates host `e2fsck -fn` plus `debugfs` validation of the post-test image.
The updated target passes. `make test-virtio` and `make test-integration` also
pass after the `virtio_blk`/`blkcache` cleanup.

### 16:08 — xHCI correctness hardening

**Current problem:** QEMU's direct-attached storage path passed, but review
found specification, concurrency, malformed-input, and test-oracle cases that
could fail on a physical controller or hide a failed guest copy.

**Activity completed:** corrected scratchpad-count decoding, preserved chained
transfer TDs across ring wrap, rejected truncated configuration descriptors,
serialized device flush callbacks with ordinary block I/O, negotiated EP0
packet size from the device descriptor, sized the PCI BAR with decoding and bus
mastering disabled, validated controller register ranges, and avoided writes to
PCI status bits. UHCI enumeration now falls through to xHCI when no UHCI
mass-storage device is attached. The persistence runner removes any old result
before boot, so its mandatory host extraction and byte comparison cannot pass
on stale output.

**QA delivered:** sequential q35 xHCI persistence, q35 xHCI no-device, UHCI
persistence, POSIX I/O, and build-tool gates pass. A final focused code review
found no blocking correctness issues. Physical N150 readiness remains
unclaimed; BARs above 4 GiB, hubs/hotplug, interrupts, robust recovery, and
hardware qualification remain unsupported.

### 16:02 — Initial xHCI mass-storage support

**Current problem:** keep a boot thumb drive available as writable root storage
after firmware handoff on modern Intel systems that expose USB through xHCI.

**Activity completed:** added a polling xHCI backend under the existing USB
descriptor/BOT/block layer. It discovers PCI class `0c0330`, performs ownership
handoff and bounded controller/port reset, manages command/event/control/bulk
rings, supports 32/64-byte contexts and scratchpads, configures one directly
attached MSC device, and reuses `usb0`/`usb0p0`. Added synchronous SCSI
`SYNCHRONIZE CACHE(10)` and serialized `fsync` page-cache/device flushes. Fixed
the kernel Make dependency so changes to text-included `xhci.c` cannot reuse a
stale object.

**QA delivered:** `make test-usb-storage-xhci` passes on QEMU q35 with a
separate firmware boot CD, xHCI-only image attachment, USB FAT root, guest
write/`fsync`, successful device-cache synchronization, and byte-identical host
readback. `make test-usb-storage-xhci-no-device`, the UHCI persistence gate, and
`make test-posixio` pass. Physical N150 readiness remains unclaimed pending BAR
mapping above 4 GiB, hubs/hotplug/recovery, interrupt/DMA hardening, and laptop
qualification.

### 15:48 — QEMU USB-controller qualification

**Current problem:** qualify the image through an actual emulated USB host
controller, without allowing firmware boot or CD fallback to masquerade as USB
root support, and make the N150 xHCI gap executable.

**Activity completed:** the first separate-CD UHCI probe enumerated `usb0p0`
but returned a zero FAT BPB and divided by zero during mount. The UHCI BOT path
advertised 32 KiB SCSI commands while its DMA buffer and 32 transfer descriptors
could carry only 2 KiB. Expanded both capacities to the intended 32 KiB and
added an explicit bulk-transfer bound. Added isolated QEMU UHCI persistence and
xHCI expected-gap runners with unique artifacts, explicit timeouts, positive
controller/root assertions, fatal-fault checks, and negative fallback checks.

**QA delivered:** `make test-usb-storage` boots from CD, enumerates the image
only through UHCI, mounts USB root, performs guest copy plus `fsync`, and passes
host byte comparison. `make test-usb-storage-xhci-gap` reports
`EXPECTED_GAP xHCI unsupported`, mounts the CD root, and confirms no `usb0`
registration. This does not change N150 readiness: a passing xHCI persistence
lane and physical laptop qualification remain required.

### 15:35 — BIOS/UEFI USB image persistence and Intel N150 readiness

**Current problem:** produce a safely flashable image that boots from a thumb
drive and uses its FAT32 partition as writable working storage, validate it
without touching the attached SanDisk drive, and identify what prevents use on
an Intel N150 laptop.

**Activity completed:** added a disposable VirtualBox image gate for BIOS and
UEFI, serial boot observation, guest file creation, explicit `fsync`, poweroff,
VDI-to-raw conversion, and host byte comparison. Fixed duplicate GRUB
`diskboot.img` embedding, recursive app staging, FAT-table I/O requests that
were too large for the page cache, block-cache callbacks that lost partition
device context, and `cp.exe` durability/error reporting. The FAT regression
uses a dedicated `/work` directory and 8.3 names because the current driver has
limited long-filename/root-directory growth behavior.

**QA delivered:** `make test-vbox-usb-image` and
`make test-vbox-usb-image-efi` pass with `Root mount [OK]` and byte-identical
persistent readback. `make test-io-unit` passes TAP 12/12 and
`make test-buildtools` passes under QEMU. The physical `/dev/sdc` device was not
written. Added `ics-os/docs/intel-n150-usb-readiness.md`: VirtualBox qualifies
the image as an IDE-backed BIOS/UEFI disk, while xHCI remains the release
blocker for continued access to a physical USB root on N150 hardware.

### Current — intermittent post-fork return corruption

**Current problem:** two-vCPU fork testing intermittently corrupted either the
child's copied syscall return or the console's return after the fork test had
exited. The latter jumped to `ps_dequeue` at `0x12c1f1` while retaining the
departed fork test's CR3, directly implicating a partial context transition.

**Activity completed:** traced fork return, wait/reap, self-exit, scheduler
claims, and per-CPU current state. The decisive failure freed the fork test's
PML4 and then faulted in `virtio_blk_retire_owner()` under that same stale CR3.
`ps_switchto()` published the destination as `current_process` while RSP and
CR3 still belonged to the previous process; a timer in that handoff could save
the mixed live state into the destination context. Context save/load also had
narrow preemption windows. The handoff now disables interrupts before current
publication, and the assembly paths disable them before context manipulation;
the destination RFLAGS restore re-enables interrupts.

**QA delivered:** one focused `make -C ics-os test-fork FORK_CPUS=2` passed,
followed by five consecutive isolated passes. Every run completed the normal,
text-fault, COW fast/copy, injected-OOM, inherited-fd, wait, and delayed-reap
checks without GPF, double fault, `CTXBAD`, or stale-CR3 return corruption.

### 13:05 — x86-64 copy-on-write fork Phase 2

**Current problem:** Phase 1 cloned every private user page eagerly. Phase 2
needed reference-counted frames, writable-origin PTE metadata, write-protection
fault handling, SMP-safe invalidation, correct executable permissions, and
deterministic failure coverage. User ELFs still run at CPL0, making their active
user/syscall stack unsafe to share read-only while kernel frames use it.

**Activity completed:** added low-4-GiB frame references and COW-aware teardown;
`userpd_clone_cow()` now shares ordinary writable ELF pages, preserves text as
read-only, and eagerly copies the active user/syscall stacks. Enabled `CR0.WP`
on BSP and AP startup. COW write faults serialize PTE mutation, copy shared
frames or use a one-owner writable fast path, and synchronously invalidate CPUs
running the matching CR3 through IPI vector `0xFB`. Added per-CPU page-fault
recursion state, bounded COW counters/traces, and one-shot allocation-failure
injection. Synchronous exec now consumes direct-child `waitpid` status so an
expected fault in a grandchild cannot poison a healthy parent.

An attempted expansion of the VM lock into every public map/unmap/free call
deadlocked the second fork during teardown and caused trap-frame corruption
under SMP. It was removed after reproducing the regression; clone snapshot and
COW fault mutation retain the lock, while fork continues to reject concurrent
threads and in-flight user-buffer I/O. General shared-address-space mutation is
not yet exposed by this process model.

**QA delivered:** the guest test verifies parent/child COW writes, isolation,
one-owner writes after child teardown, immutable text, injected COW OOM recovery,
inherited descriptors, wait ownership/status, and delayed ten-child reaping.
`make test-fork FORK_CPUS=2`, `make test-fork-matrix` (1/2/4/8 vCPUs), `make
test-integration`, and `make test-spawn` all passed. Remaining expansion gates
are dedicated unmap/exit races, shootdown delay/loss injection, DMA-pinned pages,
and remote shootdown exercise after user-process CPU migration is supported.

### Current — x86-64 eager-copy fork Phase 1

**Current problem:** SDK `fork()` exposes syscall `0x90`, but its kernel path
shallow-copies the PCB and invokes the legacy two-level 32-bit page copier. It
truncates PML4/CR3 addresses, disables paging globally, does not establish the
child CR3, and has no transactional rollback. Dispatcher mediation is also
pointer-truncating and SMP-racy. Child accounting, targeted-wait ownership,
durable zombie status, orphan handling, multithread snapshot semantics, and
async user-buffer I/O policy are incomplete. The nominal COW fault path lacks
long-mode page walking, frame references, PTE locking, TLB shootdown, and safe
OOM handling. No fork-specific tests exist.

**Activity completed:** audited the syscall, dispatcher, PCB lifecycle,
long-mode and legacy VM paths, trap-frame ABI, descriptor inheritance,
wait/exit behavior, SDK wrappers, and available tests. Confirmed that typed fd
references and `userpd_create()`/`userpd_map_region()`/`userpd_free()` are useful
foundations, but the current fork path is unsafe and nonfunctional on x86-64.
Added `ics-os/docs/fork-modernization-plan.md`: Phase 0 safely returns `-ENOSYS`
and closes adjacent isolation/wait gaps; Phase 1 implements a synchronous,
trap-frame-defined, transactional eager-copy fork; Phase 2 adds COW only after
frame reference counts, address-space locking, software PTE metadata, and SMP
TLB shootdown exist.

**Phase 1 completed:** syscall `0x90` now bypasses the unsafe dispatcher and
uses a copied interrupt frame with explicit child `rax=0`. The kernel eagerly
clones private four-level user mappings with rollback, builds a fresh PCB,
duplicates memory metadata and parameters, inherits typed descriptors as one
transaction, and publishes PID/accounting/scheduler state last. Fork rejects
multithreaded callers, shared page directories, in-flight io_uring, and exhausted
child-status capacity. Targeted `waitpid` now rejects non-children, descriptor
rollback covers slots 0-2, and accepted forks cannot silently lose status.

**QA delivered:** `make test-fork` validates return values, private data/stack,
shared inherited file state, non-child wait rejection, `_exit` status, and ten
children retained before delayed reaping. QEMU exit status is mandatory rather
than ignored. `make test-fork-matrix` passed under 1/2/4/8 vCPUs with no page,
general-protection, or double fault. Deterministic allocator-failure injection,
explicit multithread/io_uring rejection tests, orphan policy, and COW remain.
GCC continues to use `posix_spawn()`; `vfork()` remains `ENOSYS`.

### Current — SMP scaling from two to eight CPUs

**Current problem:** the kernel could start four QEMU CPUs, but the supported
gate covered only two, the context-switch reentrancy guard had four fixed
entries, AP online publication occurred before per-CPU initialization finished,
IPI writes did not wait for xAPIC delivery, and `createkthread()` followed by
`ps_set_affinity()` allowed a new thread to run on the wrong CPU. Concurrent AP
diagnostic output also corrupted or stalled the legacy serial path at eight CPUs.

**Activity completed:** retained the existing `MAX_CPUS=8` boundary and made it
real: AP slot claim and online publication are separate, initialization is
release-published before the BSP continues, startup uses bounded acknowledgement
with one SIPI retry, and every xAPIC ICR command waits for delivery-idle. Added
`createkthread_on_cpu()` so affinity is installed before ready-queue insertion;
migrated foreground-manager, console, and SMP-test workers to it. Sized the
context-switch guard with `MAX_CPUS`. The SMP proof now runs one targeted pinned
worker at a time on every AP with bounded reschedule retries and publishes one
BSP aggregate CPU mask instead of unsafe concurrent AP prints. COM1 output now
uses an IRQ-safe SMP lock, and `serial_puts()` holds it across a complete record.
The test oracle consumes dedicated atomic `SMP_RESULT` online and work-steal
records rather than interleavable console prose. `test-smp` defaults to four
CPUs and accepts `SMP_CPUS=1..8`; `test-smp-matrix` covers 1/2/4/8.
Context-load and voluntary-switch guards are now indexed per CPU. FPU
save/restore uses one aligned 512-byte scratch area per CPU instead of a global
buffer that concurrent context switches could corrupt.

**QA delivered with the feature:** GCC kernel builds succeeded. The complete
1/2/4/8 QEMU matrix passed exact online-count, root-mount, AP-scheduling,
per-AP execution-mask, and no-GPF gates. The canonical `test-integration` suite
then passed boot, default four-CPU SMP, and ELF64 execution. Three additional
eight-CPU context-switch stress runs passed after the per-CPU FPU conversion,
followed by another complete matrix and integration run. QEMU SMP and boot
processes are intentionally stopped by timeout after required markers; timeout
124 is ignored by those recipes and is not an emulator clean-exit claim.

**Residual work:** current firmware discovery assumes contiguous xAPIC IDs.
ACPI MADT and x2APIC enumeration, sparse IDs, NUMA-aware scheduling, CPU hotplug,
per-CPU structured logging, larger dynamic CPU masks, and repeated long-duration
I/O/filesystem contention matrices remain required for production-scale SMP.

### Current — scheduler waits and address-space-safe async retirement

**Current problem:** io_uring CQ and close waits still polled with `cpu_idle()`,
while a proposed global callback worker exposed a more serious constraint:
virtio read completion copied bounce data through the submitter's user virtual
address under the worker's unrelated CR3. Ring-close timeout and inherited-ring
process exit could also release page tables while a late copyback remained.

**Activity completed:** added scheduler-backed hashed event wait queues keyed by
completion address, preserving the fixed 64-byte virtio slot while providing
prepare/recheck/block/finish and IRQ-safe wake-all semantics. io_uring now blocks
for bounded one-tick intervals between owner-context harvests, with a nonzero
deadline helper so tick wrap cannot become the zero/unbounded sentinel. Virtio
slots record the submitting address-space token outside the compact slot;
successful read copyback is drained only under that address space, while error
callbacks remain address-independent. Close timeout stops DMA with device reset
before callback retirement. Every process fd teardown unconditionally retires
that address space's requests, including completed-but-undrained reads, before
page tables may be released. A global I/O-manager callback drain remains
disabled until user pages can be pinned and kernel-mapped.

**QA delivered with the feature:** host `test-io-unit` remains 12/12. A GCC
kernel rebuild, two-process/two-vCPU `test-posixio`, and the deterministic
two-vCPU virtio reset marker gate completed successfully. The virtio runner's
expected timeout 124 occurs only after required markers and is ignored by the
Make recipe. Focused code review approved the address-space filtering,
completed-request sanitization, inherited-ring process teardown, deadline wrap,
and reset initialization changes with no remaining finding.

**Residual work:** add deterministic foreign-CR3, inherited-ring owner-exit,
completed-read cancellation, and tick-rollover fault tests. A true autonomous
bottom half requires DMA pinning/kernel mappings or a referenced address-space
object; broader legacy `waiting`/poll-loop migration is still pending.

### Current — typed fd references and inheritance

**Current problem:** ring descriptors now survive concurrent close, but VFS and
block fd slots still expose raw pointers, descriptor inheritance copies those
pointers without ownership transfer, and close can race active read/write/stat
operations or free one inherited object more than once.

**Activity completed:** introduced separate VFS descriptor, direct legacy
`FILE *`, and transient-operation references; typed block and io_uring
owner/active references;
atomic fdget/detach; and per-open-description offset/I/O serialization. Both
process creation paths now increment typed ownership while holding the parent fd
table lock and skip reserved slots. All process teardown paths detach and close
their fd tables. io_uring last-close waiting now has exclusive final-release
ownership with a timeout handoff to callbacks, avoiding competing frees.
SDK `fdopen()` now records its descriptor and `fclose()` flushes then closes that
descriptor; duplicate ambiguous registrations are rejected. Internal kernel
threads no longer inherit user descriptors, while the dormant fork path now
uses referenced cloning instead of copying the lock and raw pointers.
All fdopen-backed stdio read/write/seek/tell/flush paths route through referenced
fd syscalls rather than raw `file_PCB` operations. Positioned block operations
and io_uring submission are serialized against flush submission, preserving
virtqueue ordering for durability.

**QA delivered with the feature:** `test-spawn` now spawns itself with an open
FAT descriptor, closes the parent copy, requires the child to write and sync,
then reopens and verifies the data (`FD_INHERIT_CHILD_PASS` and
`FD_INHERIT_PASS`). A clean GCC kernel build completed. `test-io-unit` emitted
12/12 TAP successes; `test-spawn`, two-process/two-vCPU `test-posixio`,
two-vCPU virtio reset/recovery, and the boot/SMP/exec integration marker gates
completed successfully. The boot/SMP/virtio QEMU processes are intentionally
terminated by their runner timeouts after required markers; those timeout
statuses are ignored by the recipes and are not reported as emulator PASS.
The fdopen-heavy in-OS GNU assembler/archiver/linker test was rebuilt and
emitted every required marker through `BINTOOLS_PASS`. Final scoped code review
reported no blocking ownership issue.

**Residual work:** add repeated multi-vCPU clone/close/exit stress and an
in-kernel deterministic close-while-VFS-operation-held test, then proceed to
scheduler blocked wait queues, bottom halves, and finer-grained VFS/cache locks.

### Current — I/O lifetime, quiesce, completion, and recovery foundations

**Current problem:** the first P0 correctness slice prevents immediate lock,
publication, and DMA-slot reuse defects, but registry lookups, VFS/fd waiters,
permanently stalled virtio requests, and polling waits still lack the referenced
lifetime, quiesce/drain, completion, and reset contracts required for safe SMP
teardown.

**Activity completed:** added referenced device lookup/put with generation and
`LIVE -> QUIESCING -> DEAD` state, pending removal until active callbacks drain,
and additive exported compatibility APIs. Migrated block-cache and I/O-manager
callbacks, moved global block flush callbacks outside the registry lock, and
pinned filesystem/block interfaces for each mounted VFS root through unmount.
Device generation is now part of cache-page, fill, writeback, and block-size
identity, and every queued I/O carries the expected generation through device
acquisition. Mount/unmount use one transaction gate; an atomic block-device
claim is retained through teardown and cache invalidation.
Replaced raw virtio and io_uring PCB waiters with acquire/release one-shot
completions and cross-CPU reschedule notification. Added bounded virtio reset,
exactly-once failure of outstanding chains, queue reconstruction, reset counters,
and deterministic held-completion fault injection followed by DMA readback.
Failure to acknowledge reset quarantines all unresolved slots rather than
pretending DMA ownership returned.
Hard IRQ now only harvests descriptor state. User-buffer callbacks are drained
under the submitter address space; process teardown resets and retires its
outstanding callbacks before page-table release. Ring syscalls hold close-safe
references, timed-out close has deferred final release, and fd allocation
reserves slots under the process fd-table lock.

**QA delivered with the feature:** expanded the host TAP suite from 3 to 12
cases for reference acquisition, quiesce rejection, drain/retirement, underflow
rejection, device-generation cache identity, and completion-before-wait.
`test-virtio` now requires
`VIRTIO_RESET_RECOVERY_OK`. Full GCC kernel rebuild, two-vCPU `test-virtio`, and
two-process/two-vCPU `test-posixio` pass.

**Residual work:** fd/open-file and mount/dentry/inode refcounts, process-safe fd
table cloning and detach-on-close, scheduler blocked wait queues, IRQ bottom
halves, device destructors/IRQ synchronization, DMA mapping/pinning, and the
scalable page-cache state/index model remain required before production claims.

### Current — P0 I/O correctness implementation

**Current problem:** verified VFS, FAT, cache, virtio, and io_uring defects could
deadlock, corrupt metadata, lose redirtied data, reuse hardware-owned DMA state,
or complete through freed ring storage.

**Activity completed:** implemented atomic process+CPU ownership for legacy
process-context critical sections and an IRQ-save spinlock API. Added structured
VFS create cleanup and serialized open/close/unmount transitions. FAT now checks
failed allocation before cluster access and serializes metadata per volume.
Cache writeback uses generations. Virtio queue state is SMP-serialized and
timed-out slots remain owned until used-ring retirement. io_uring now uses
acquire/release publication, CQ capacity/overflow handling, locked callback and
in-flight state, and close-time drain. Device remove/lock updates are atomic.

**QA delivered with the feature:** added `test-io-unit`, a TAP 13 host test for
cache writeback generation, redirty, and slot-reuse decisions. Extended
`posixio` with close-while-DMA-in-flight readback and a rejected-create lock
regression; the target runs twice under different PIDs on two vCPUs.
`test-virtio` now uses two vCPUs. Headless targets touched during validation now
detach stdin. A full rebuild exposed and repaired incomplete ext4 integration:
forward declaration/linkage/field typos and the missing linker input.

**Validated results:** GCC kernel build PASS; `test-io-unit` 3/3 PASS;
`test-posixio`, `test-virtio`, `test-smp`, `test-spawn`, and
`test-integration` PASS. Boot/SMP/virtio recipes intentionally terminate QEMU
after asserted markers, so GNU `timeout` reports 124 before log validation.
Strict GCC self-host certification remains a separate known failure.

**Residual work:** refcounted VFS/device/fd objects, quiescing removal,
scheduler completions/wait queues, virtio reset for permanently stalled
requests, process-safe waiter references, deterministic in-transfer redirty
injection, and finer-grained locks.

### Current — feature-integrated QA policy

**Current problem:** ensure the testing and QA modernization plan is implemented
continuously as production features are built instead of being deferred as an
independent future effort.

**Activity completed:** updated `AGENTS.md` to make tests, assertions, diagnostics,
deterministic fault hooks, structured results, and relevant QA infrastructure part
of each feature's definition of done. The policy requires the lowest practical test
layer, regression tests for defects, multi-vCPU and lifecycle/failure coverage for
concurrent kernel subsystems, truthful command outcomes, and incremental reusable
test infrastructure rather than new ad hoc marker conventions. It preserves the
canonical GCC self-host and Multiboot2/QEMU gates while allowing newer compiler and
instrumentation lanes as additional evidence.

### Current — testing and QA framework assessment

**Current problem:** evaluate whether the existing build, unit, integration,
continuous-integration, stress, security, performance, and hardware-validation
framework is sufficient for a production-oriented concurrent operating system,
then define a practical modernization path without weakening the canonical GCC
self-host contract.

**Activity completed:** inventoried all 25 top-level `test-*` targets, their QEMU
configurations and serial-marker oracles, the narrow `test-integration` aggregate,
warning suppression, ignored application builds, fixed `/tmp` artifacts, container
privileges, and the absence of repository CI, structured results, unit tests,
coverage, sanitizers, fuzzing, systematic fault injection, and a hardware lab.
Direct source verification corrected stale claims: child exit status and the
post-kexec script path are implemented, while the binutils test comment describing
the old status behavior is obsolete. The review also identified that the common
kernel `assert()` is currently a no-op, so debug builds do not enforce general
runtime invariants.

The resulting assessment and phased design is in
`ics-os/docs/testing-and-qa-modernization-plan.md`. It preserves the valuable
Multiboot2/QEMU/self-host vertical tests but places them above host-native units,
in-kernel KTAP suites, and guest TAP selftests. It defines strict QEMU process
supervision, run-scoped evidence, JUnit conversion, warning debt ratcheting,
unprivileged TCG pull-request CI, isolated KVM lanes, 1/2/4/8-vCPU stress, fault
injection, parser and syscall fuzzing, debug allocator/lock/DMA diagnostics,
physical-hardware qualification, performance baselines, reproducible builds, and
release provenance. GCC 4.7.4 remains canonical; newer GCC/Clang and sanitizers are
separate QA instruments.

The first implementation increment is intentionally small: make existing verdicts
truthful and parallel-safe, activate QA assertions, add a tiny freestanding KTAP
core with a host adapter, migrate boot/SMP into a structured QEMU runner, and add
an unprivileged TCG pull-request gate before expanding the matrix.

### Current — production device-driver subsystem architecture

**Current problem:** design a state-of-the-art driver subsystem for storage, USB,
networking, graphics/display, AI accelerators, audio, input, platform, and virtual
devices. The design must support automatic discovery and Plug and Play, scalable
asynchronous I/O, no-reboot load/unload/rebind/reset, fault containment and recovery,
maintainable driver APIs, production observability, and a future ARM64 port.

**Activity completed:** audited the current device manager, PCI enumerator, legacy
IRQ attachment lists, polled UHCI/mass-storage path, module loaders, synchronization,
and reusable virtio/MMIO primitives. The audit confirmed that the fixed copied-
interface registry has raw-pointer lifetime, advisory removal, and callback-under-
global-lock hazards; PCI lacks a complete bus/resource/binding lifecycle; IRQ actions
cannot be synchronously detached; UHCI has global polled state and pointer-cast DMA;
and legacy module unload is not integrated with device, IRQ, work, timer, DMA, or
callback references.

The resulting source-grounded architecture and staged implementation plan is in
`ics-os/docs/device-driver-subsystem-architecture.md`. It defines typed hierarchical
device/bus/driver/class objects, immutable IDs and generations, reference-counted
lifetime, managed resource transactions, operation gates, exact teardown ordering,
safe module replacement, IRQ domains and threaded/budgeted processing, a generic
DMA/IOMMU API, queue-local asynchronous requests, recovery domains, power/firmware
management, kernel/user driver isolation tiers, class designs, developer tooling,
structured telemetry, fault injection, acceptance criteria, and an eleven-phase
rollout.

The highest-priority implementation rule is correctness before hot unload or
multi-queue tuning. Build and stress a virtual device first; then implement safe IRQ
retirement and DMA ownership; then migrate PCI and virtio-blk as the first complete
physical lifecycle. Existing `devmgr_*` callers remain behind an adapter until each
consumer can obey the new reference and quiesce contracts.

### Current — concurrent VFS, device, and async-I/O architecture review

**Current problem:** review the VFS, device-management, and I/O stack for
correctness and scalability gaps that prevent high-performance multithreaded
and asynchronous operation. The review covers ownership and lifetime rules,
locking, per-process descriptor semantics, page/block caching, DMA and IRQ
completion, io_uring behavior, scheduler integration, observability, and the
interfaces needed for future non-x86 platforms.

**Activity completed:** mapped the POSIX/VFS/filesystem/block-cache/device/
virtio/io_uring path and verified the high-risk findings directly in source.
The resulting design and staged execution plan is in
`ics-os/docs/io-subsystem-modernization-plan.md`.

The most urgent correctness findings are that `sync_sharedvar` is not an atomic
SMP lock; VFS open/close/unmount objects have no safe reference protocol;
`createfile()` leaks its global critical section on several early returns; FAT
uses an out-of-space cluster result before checking it; block-cache writeback
can clear a concurrently redirtied page; virtio local interrupt masking does
not serialize multiple CPUs and timeout releases descriptors still owned by
the device; and io_uring can overwrite a full CQ or free a ring still referenced
by in-flight callbacks. The plan deliberately puts these lifetime, memory
ordering, error, and timeout fixes before multi-queue or zero-copy tuning.

The existing `test-posixio` and `test-virtio` paths were also classified
correctly as single-vCPU functional smoke tests. New SMP, saturation, delayed
completion, close/exit, ENOSPC, redirty/writeback, reset, and durability tests
are required before the subsystem can carry a production concurrency claim.

## 2026-09-01 (Manila, UTC+8)

### Current — strict GCC self-host certification

**Current problem:** the existing GCC kernel capstone proves that GCC/cc1/GAS/ld
executables running inside ICS-OS can build and kexec the kernel, but that alone
does not prove compiler closure. Certification now requires three independent
gates: the in-OS toolchain generates the kernel; the generated kernel boots with
no tested capability loss; and GCC is rebuilt inside ICS-OS and that rebuilt
compiler is used to rebuild the kernel/toolchain loop. Until all three gates
have reproducible passing tests with compiler provenance evidence, ICS-OS must
not be described as fully self-host capable.

**Activity now:** audit how the current GCC driver and cc1 are produced and
staged, define provenance-bearing test oracles, then implement and execute the
missing compiler-closure and capability-regression tests.

### Current — first GCC closure translation diagnosed

The apparent silent reset during `cc1` compilation of GCC's `alias.c` was not
a stack overflow. The native driver was overflowing the kernel's 1024-byte
`posix_spawn` command buffer while forwarding the closure profile. It now
writes that profile to a ramdisk response file, which GCC 4.7.4's `cc1`
expands through libiberty before option processing.

That exposed two native-process compatibility limits. Native compiler frontends
retain directory handles for many include roots, so the kernel descriptor
baseline is now 64. More decisively, POSIX `fstat` returned `(st_dev, st_ino)`
as `(0, 0)` for every VFS object. GCC therefore classified every include root
after the first as a duplicate and searched only `gccsrc/gen`, making
`config.h` unreachable. `fstat` now reports the filesystem ID and stable VFS
node identity. The GCC driver also requires a `.text` directive in frontend
output, preventing a fatal-error assembly stub from being accepted and
converted by GAS into a plausible ELF object while legacy `waitpid` status
propagation remains incomplete.

The native spawn/exec command baseline was raised from 1024 to 4096 bytes in
both the SDK and kernel. This carries GCC's complete deterministic profile
without truncation; an attempted `@response` workaround was rejected because
libiberty requires fully seekable stdio semantics. Compiler sources and headers
remain on the read-only ISO while generated objects use the writable FAT work
disk; a FAT header-staging experiment was removed because long-name lookup was
less reliable and added avoidable image preparation work.

**Performance finding:** the minimal driver did not pass `-quiet`, an internal
option the upstream GCC driver supplies on every normal cc1 invocation. cc1
therefore dumped include search state, every parsed/generated symbol, GC
progress, and timing details. The first `alias.c` translation generated roughly
1.1 million syscalls, dominated by character-at-a-time serial output, and took
over 100 seconds. The driver now always invokes cc1 with `-quiet`; diagnostic
verbosity must be explicitly reintroduced only for focused troubleshooting.

The SDK `FILE` layer was also unbuffered: GCC's assembly writes crossed
`int 0x30` in tiny, often one-byte operations. Added bounded 4 KiB per-stream
output caches with coherent `fwrite`/`fputc`/`fputs`, tell, seek, flush, and
close behavior. A follow-on input read-ahead cache was rejected after it broke
GNU ar's seek-heavy archive parser; input semantics remain unchanged. The
strict target now always asks `contrib/gcc` to update `/tmp/icsos-gcc/cc1`; previously
the mere presence of that persistent seed bypassed Make dependency checks and
could hide SDK updates. With a freshly relinked seed, total syscalls after the
first three compiler units fell from about 209,000 to about 38,000 while all
three objects still compiled and assembled successfully.

Incrementally reopening and rewriting `cc1.a` for every one of 349 objects was
both quadratic and incompatible with the current FAT/BFD path: the first
archive creation succeeded, but the second open reported an unrecognized
format. `Selfhost.mk` now compiles objects as independent resumable evidence,
then creates component archives exactly once. Both 70-path and 35-path batches
overflowed GNU Make's native command construction and faulted the guest. The
final cc1 set is partitioned into eighteen archives of at most 20 objects,
keeping each ar invocation comfortably below both Make and the 4 KiB spawn
limit; ld consumes all archives as one start-group. This removes 331 ar process
launches and avoids repeated archive replacement.

The first chunked run reached GCC's large `c-family/c-common.c` unit and
exhausted the 77,789-frame pool of the 512 MiB certification VM while cc1 held
roughly 270 MiB of private mappings. Strict certification now uses 1 GiB, the
same memory class already used by the native compiler/build-tool tests; this is
a workload capacity requirement rather than a leaked-frame workaround, since
prior units returned to a stable free-frame baseline after exit. A later full
run reached 299 objects but late tree-optimization units exhausted even the
208,861-page pool exposed by 1 GiB, so strict certification now uses 2 GiB.

That run also exposed two correctness issues hidden by the former zero-only
wait status. Several conditionally empty GCC units produced valid directive-only
assembly and were falsely rejected by the `.text`/data heuristic. The kernel
PCB now captures the low-byte exit code and both reaping paths propagate it via
`waitpid`; the GCC driver enforces that status and only requires non-empty
assembly output. GNU Make can now stop immediately on a failed child rather
than continuing with missing objects.

**Activity now:** rebuild the kernel and driver, rerun the first closure unit,
then continue the complete GCC → GNU Make → kernel certification if it passes.

### ~19:00 — GCC made the canonical self-host; TinyCC is optional

**Requirement:** kernel self-hosting must use GCC. TinyCC may bootstrap tools
but must not define completion of the supported kernel self-host path.

**Change:** `make test-kbuild` now delegates to the passing in-OS GCC → cc1 →
GAS → GNU ld → kexec test. The former TinyCC recipe is renamed
`test-tcc-kbuild`; its compiler-rebuild variant is `test-tcc-fullhost`.
The generic Make targets and kernel console commands `kbuild` and `fullhost`
now run the GCC path. `gkbuild` remains an explicit alias; `tcckbuild` and
`tccfullhost` select optional experiments. Documentation and contributor
guidance now consistently identify GCC as the supported self-host compiler.

**Validation:** `make test-kbuild` passed through the canonical target and
reported `test-gcc-kbuild PASS` followed by `test-kbuild PASS (GCC)`. The final
host kernel rebuild also passed. Long headless kbuild invocations now redirect
QEMU stdin from `/dev/null`, preventing terminal job control from suspending a
quiet `-nographic` VM.

### ~17:00 — Self-host handoff resumed; GNU-tool SDK symbol conflicts under repair

**Current problem:** the GCC-built kernel and kexec capstone is green, but the
post-kexec regression suite is incomplete.  The top-level `apps` build also has
ignored GNU make/binutils link failures because SDK compatibility routines in
`sdk/posix.c` collide with application or libiberty implementations.

**Activity now:** reviewed `HANDOFF.md`, the self-host guide, repository status,
and the pending test matrix.  Marking the seven SDK fallback implementations
(`fdopen_unlocked`, `fopen_unlocked`, `unlock_std_streams`, `strcasecmp`,
`strncasecmp`, `strsignal`, and `bsearch`) weak, then rebuilding applications
and running the pending focused and kexec regressions.

**Regression finding:** the strict `apps` rebuild is now clean and GNU make and
binutils are no longer ignored by that target. `test-cc1` and
`test-integration` pass. `test-kbuild` exposed an older TinyCC-only C89 issue in
`hardware/vga/dexvga.c`: `draw_x()` called `write_text` before its definition
and omitted its fifth (`size`) argument, so the implicit `int` declaration
conflicted with the later `void` definition. Added forward declarations for
`write_text`/`write_char` and passed size `0` (the existing 8x8 path); rerunning
the kbuild/kexec regression next.

The next TinyCC pass reached the complete `kernel32.c` amalgamation and exposed
another strict type error in `module/pe_module.c`: the `void module_listfxn()`
function returned integer status values. Its only caller ignores a result, so
the invalid `return 1`/`return 0` statements were converted to bare returns.

The following pass reached `hardware/keyboard/mouse.c` and found
`get_mouse_pos()` had no declaration in `mouse.h`; earlier calls from the
console therefore created an implicit `int` declaration that conflicted with
its `void` definition. Added the missing typed prototype to the public header.
The same preflight identified `machine_reboot()` as another `void` routine used
before definition, so its existing hardware API header now declares it too.

With frontend errors resolved, `test-kbuild` reached TinyCC's internal link and
showed that the legacy object list had fallen behind the production kernel:
virtio-blk symbols were unresolved, and TinyCC does not consume the GNU linker
script that normally defines `bssEnd`. Added `hardware/virtio/virtio_blk.c` to
the TinyCC compile/link set. Added a `bssEnd` marker to the final C compatibility
object, which is intentionally linked after the kernel C objects so startup's
BSS clear retains its end-marker semantics.

The first retry still used the old in-OS `kbuild_run()` object list because the
top-level `vmdex` target shares a name with a checked-in file but was not phony;
Make therefore skipped `make -C kernel`. Marked `vmdex` phony so test targets
always perform the incremental kernel build and cannot silently boot stale code.

After rebuilding the guest, TinyCC compiled and internally linked the current
object set, but its ad-hoc `-Ttext` layout produced a kexeced kernel whose LAPIC
2 MiB identity-map entry faulted with reserved bits before `KEXEC_BOOT_OK`.
The GCC path already proved that the production GNU linker script has the safe
layout. Updated `kbuild_run()` to retain TinyCC for all C compilation but link
with the in-OS GNU `ld.exe` plus `lscript64-objs.ld`; both `test-kbuild` and
`test-fullhost` now stage the linker. This also removes the temporary synthetic
`bssEnd`, since the real script defines the exact end of BSS.

The first GNU-ld attempt exposed link semantics previously hidden by TinyCC's
internal linker: the kbuild command used `-fno-common` even though the production
kernel uses `-fcommon`, creating repeated header-defined BSS symbols such as
`time_systime`; and `tcccompat.c` duplicated `stopints`/`startints`, which the
TinyCC-compiled `kernel32.c` amalgamation already emits. Switched the in-OS C
compile to `-fcommon` and removed those redundant compatibility definitions.

GNU ld then produced an ELF, but the TinyCC object model did not preserve the
boot-time fallback map correctly under that link: the kexeced kernel reported
zero frames and faulted before process initialization. Restored TinyCC's own
linker (while keeping the current virtio object list and synthetic end-of-BSS
marker). The earlier internally linked kernel had reached LAPIC timer setup but
faulted with a reserved-bit page error after the 64-bit MMIO PDE compound OR;
an explicit load/OR/store experiment produced the identical fault and was
reverted.

**Final verification this session:** `test-make` passes (`MAKE_TCC_OK`,
`MAKE_PASS`) and `test-bintools` passes (`AS_PASS`, `AR_PASS`, `LD_PASS`,
`BINTOOLS_PASS`). The weak SDK fallbacks therefore work both at link time and
at runtime. `test-kbuild` remains blocked only by the reproducible LAPIC
reserved-bit fault in the kexeced TinyCC-built kernel; its compile, link,
ELF validation, staging, and jump all succeed before that fault.

### ~16:30 — **test-gcc-kbuild PASS** + machine handoff prepared

**Current problem (solved for the capstone test):** `test-gcc-kbuild` was failing after in-OS GCC compiled/assembled all kernel objects. Two independent blockers remained:

1. GCC emitted Sun-style dotted cmov forms (`cmovq.be`, `cmovl.le`, ...) that in-OS GAS 2.23 rejected.
2. The kexec trampoline copied the staged kernel image to `0x100000` with `rep movsb` while paging was still enabled. The running kernel's page tables are in `.bss` inside the destination range, so larger images could clobber page-table entries still needed by the copy and hang before `KEXEC_BOOT_OK`.

**Fixes:**
- `contrib/gcc/Makefile`: removed `-DHAVE_AS_IX86_CMOV_SUN_SYNTAX=1` so GCC emits plain cmov mnemonics accepted by in-OS GAS.
- `kernel/console/selfhost.c`: removed `-Map /ramdisk/mapfile.txt` from the in-OS `ld` link command in `gkbuild`. This avoids the SDK stdio/map-output path that GPF'd in `ld.exe`. Treat as a workaround; do not re-enable `-Map` until SDK printf/vfprintf is hardened.
- `kernel/kexec.S`: trampoline now stashes MB2 data and the copy source/count, drops to 32-bit mode, disables paging/PAE/PGE/LME, and only then performs the physical `rep movsb` to `0x100000`.

**Verification:**
- `make -C ics-os/kernel bzImage`
- `make -C ics-os test-gcc-kbuild` → **PASS**
- `/tmp/icsos-gkbuild.log` contains `GKBUILD_LINK_OK`, `GKBUILD_TEST_PASS`, `KBUILD_KEXEC`, and `KEXEC_BOOT_OK`.

**Known issue found during aborted regression:** `make apps` has ignored link failures for GNU make/binutils due to duplicate strong symbols between `sdk/posix.c` and app-provided implementations (`strcasecmp`, `strncasecmp`, `strsignal`, `fdopen_unlocked`, `fopen_unlocked`, `unlock_std_streams`, `bsearch`). This blocks clean `test-make`/`test-bintools` verification and should be fixed with weak SDK symbols or build exclusions.

**Pending before commit:** `test-cc1`, `test-integration`, and `test-kbuild` have not been completed after the `kexec.S` change. The aborted `test-kbuild` run should not be counted.

**Activity now:** machine handoff created in `HANDOFF.md`. Do not commit until regressions are complete or the user explicitly accepts the current partial state.

### ~05:50 — **test-cc1 PASS with real GGC collection** (1000-function probe)

**Current problem (solved):** in-OS `cc1` compiled all 1000 functions only if collection was postponed (`--param ggc-min-heapsize=524288`). With default GC it GPFed in `instantiate_decl_rtl` (`rax` = x86 prologue bytes) after `{GC …}` during assemble.

**Cause:** snapshotted `gtype-desc.c` was generated without the i386 `machine_function` type (`GTY((maybe_undef))`). The marker did `gcc_assert (!(*x).machine)` and never walked `stack_locals` / `split_stack_varargs_pointer`. Host gcc ≥ 4.5 turns that assert into `__builtin_unreachable` when `machine` is set. Parse/IPA GCs were fine (`machine` still NULL); the collect at `fn_64` (`{GC 21194k -> 18486k}`) ran after RTL expand and swept live `stack_local_entry` / DECL RTL.

**Fix:**
- `gt_ggc_mx_machine_function` in `contrib/gcc/shims/shim-ggc-alloc.c`; `gt_ggc_mx_function` calls it.
- `ggc_set_mark` / 64-bit page-table lookup refuse non-GC pointers instead of NULL-walking the chain.
- SDK `malloc` header magic so `free` of a non-malloc pointer is ignored.

**Verification:** `make test-cc1 CC1_TIMEOUT=300` **PASS**. Log has multiple `{GC …}` including during assemble, then `CC1_TEST_PASS`. No `ggc-min-heapsize` override on the cc1 command line.

**Next:** `test-gcc-kbuild` / larger in-OS compiles; consider regenerating `gtype-desc` from gengtype so the shim walker is not a permanent overlay.

### ~04:40 — Kernel anonymous mmap for GGC zone collector (in-OS cc1 corruption)

**Current problem:** in-OS cc1 1000-function probe still fails. `delete_tree_ssa()` saw
four corrupted `gimple_referenced_vars` slots (`0x10`, `0x10`, `0x10`, `0x300000000`).
`BADVAR_INSERT` is in the cc1 binary; the last serial log never printed it, so the
bad pointers were not inserted through `referenced_var_check_and_insert()`. Host
harnesses (including Valgrind on the SDK malloc harness) still pass.

**Hypothesis:** GCC 4.7.4 `ggc-zone.c` puts small pages in `mmap()` and large objects
in `xmalloc()`. ICS-OS `mmap()` was malloc/sbrk-backed, so both lived in
`0x0A000000+`. Zone page-table lookup indexes the containing 4KiB page of a possibly
unaligned large-object pointer, which can collide with a small GGC page and overwrite
live GC objects (hash entries).

**Fix:** real kernel anonymous mmap/munmap (`int 0x30` `0xB6`/`0xB7`). mmap grows down
from `MEM_USER_HEAP_LIMIT`; sbrk grows up from `MEM_USER_HEAP`. SDK `mmap()` uses the
syscall for `MAP_ANONYMOUS`. File-backed maps stay malloc-backed.

**Activity now:** rebuild kernel + relink in-OS cc1 (new `posix.c`) and run `test-cc1`.

### ~05:10 — test-cc1 after kernel mmap: collision ruled out; corruption is content-based

**Result:** `test-cc1` still fails, but the layout changed as intended.

- GGC hash tables moved to high mmap VA: `refvars=3fc91f90 entries=3fbe5660` (was `a6ddf90` / `aa77660`).
- sbrk break at assemble is `bfed010` (was `eb2a010`); malloc no longer backs GGC quires.
- **No `BADVAR_INSERT`.** Bad pointers are not coming from `referenced_var_check_and_insert()`.
- **fn_0 still has the same four slots:** `0x10, 0x10, 0x10, 0x300000000` at indices 9–12. Same pattern after relocation ⇒ not sbrk/mmap page-table collision.
- fn_1, fn_2, fn_3 hash dumps look fully valid (previously ICE on fn_1).
- New crash: `PF64 cr2=0x100000095 rip=ix86_instantiate_decls` with `rax=0x10000008d`. That is `stack_local_entry.next` walked as a pointer; accessing `s->rtl` at offset 8. Value has bit 32 set (`1<<32 | 0x8d`).

**Next:** treat remaining corruption as GGC mark/sweep or a 32-vs-64-bit store into a pointer field (bit 32), not SDK mmap-in-malloc overlap.

## 2026-08-31 (Manila, UTC+8)

### ~08:00 — **MILESTONE: in-OS `gcc` driver composes `cc1/as/ld` (`test-gccdriver` PASS)** + flaky `test-spawn` fixed (atomic `printf` + `waitpid` zombie fix)

**Goal (user):** "Continue if you have next steps." The `test-gcc` milestone was
committed/pushed (`96d426e`). Two things remained: (a) finish and commit/push the
`test-gccdriver` milestone (the in-OS `gcc` front-end driver), and (b) a flaky
`test-spawn` (serial tearing + an intermittent `waitpid` hang) was blocking clean
regression verification of the whole GCC self-host chain.

**Problem 1 — `test-spawn` flaky (two independent root causes, both fixed):**

1. **Serial tearing.** User `printf()` emitted one byte at a time (syscall `6`
   `putcEX`, `API_REQUIRE_INTS` re-enabled interrupts per byte), so kernel console
   output (e.g. `userpd` teardown, `ICS-OS: rebooting`) interleaved and split user
   lines (`Heluserpd...`, `SPAWNuserpd...`). Fix: a new kernel syscall `0xB5`
   `console_puts` (in `kernel/console/dexio.c`, registered in
   `kernel/dexapi/dex32API.c` **without** `API_REQUIRE_INTS` so IF stays cleared for
   the whole string) that emits a full line atomically. SDK `printf()`
   (`sdk/tccsdk.c`) now formats into a 1024-byte stack buffer via `vsprintf()` and
   emits the whole line with one `dexsdk_systemcall(0xB5, ...)`.
2. **Intermittent `waitpid` hang.** Child self-exit (`exit()` → `taskswitch()`)
   leaves a live zombie PCB until the deferred timer frees it; `schedule_from_timer()`
   populates the parent's `waitq` and switches to the parent. The old
   `dex32_waitpid()` only checked `ps_findprocess(pid)`, so it could still see the
   live zombie and `ps_switchto()` into the dead child → parent/child spin → QEMU
   timeout. Fix: `dex32_waitpid()` (`kernel/process/process.c`) now returns if the
   target pid is already in the current process's `waitq_pid[]`.

Also fixed `contrib/hello/Makefile` (link `sdk/posix.c` + `-nostdinc -I$(SDK)/include`)
so `hello.exe` (used by `test-exec`/`test-integration`) builds with the new atomic SDK.

**Result:** `make test-spawn` **5/5 PASS** with clean oracles (`SPAWN_PASS` +
`WORK_DISK_PASS` + `Hello World from ICS-OS!` as intact lines).

**Problem 2 — `test-gccdriver` (the milestone).** The in-OS `gcc` front-end driver
(`contrib/gccdriver/gccdriver.c`, built to `gcc.exe`) parses options and drives
`cc1 → as → ld` via `pexecute`/`posix_spawn`, so a single `gcc x.c -o x` works. New
`gccdrv` console builtin (`kernel/console/console.c`) stages a probe + the 5 SDK runtime
`.o`s onto `/ramdisk`, runs `gcc.exe /ramdisk/drvprobe.c -o /ramdisk/drvprobe.exe`,
then execs the result. New `make test-gccdriver` target (`ics-os/Makefile`) builds a
Multiboot2 ISO with `gcc.exe`/`cc1.exe`/`as.exe`/`ld.exe` + runtime `.o`s +
`ldscripts/`, and greps `Root mount [OK]` + `gccdrv:` + `GCC_DRIVER_OK` + `GCC_DRV_OK`
+ `GCC_DRV_RUN_OK` (and no `GCC_DRV_FAIL`).

**Result:** `make test-gccdriver` **PASS** — the in-OS `gcc` driver compiles,
assembles, links and execs `drvprobe.c` entirely on ICS-OS.

**Heap fix (uncommitted carry-over from the cc1 effort):** `ELF_HEAP_COMMIT` 8 MiB →
**256 KiB** (`kernel/module/elf_module.c`) + comment (`kernel/memory/dexmem.c`). The
userpd pool (32 MiB = 8192 frames) must hold a *parent* AND a large child (the ~18 MiB
cc1, which grows ~9 MiB via `sbrk`) concurrently; the 8 MiB eager per-process commit
made parent + cc1 exceed the pool and cc1's heap growth failed. 256 KiB up front is
ample for tool startup; `sbrk`/`dex32_sbrk` cover the rest.

**Regressions (all PASS):** `test-integration` (boot + SMP + exec), `test-gccdriver`,
`test-cc1`, `test-gcc`, `test-bintools`.

**Files touched:** `kernel/console/dexio.c` (`console_puts`), `kernel/dexapi/dex32API.c`
(syscall `0xB5`), `sdk/tccsdk.c` (atomic `printf`), `kernel/process/process.c`
(`waitpid` zombie fix), `contrib/hello/Makefile` (posix.c + include path),
`apps/hello.exe` + `apps/spawn.exe` (rebuilt), `kernel/module/elf_module.c` +
`kernel/memory/dexmem.c` (heap commit), `kernel/console/console.c` (`gccdrv` builtin),
`contrib/gccdriver/` (new: `gccdriver.c` + `Makefile`), `ics-os/Makefile`
(`test-gccdriver` target), `docs/gcc-selfhost.md` (rounds + tests), `development_blog.md`
(this entry).

**Next:** commit + push the `test-gccdriver` milestone (+ `test-spawn` fix + heap fix);
then that GCC compiles ICS-OS.

**Activity now:** `test-gccdriver` is green — the in-OS `gcc` front-end driver composes
cc1/as/ld to build **and** run a C program; the flaky `test-spawn` is fixed. Next:
commit + push.

## 2026-08-30 (Manila, UTC+8)

### ~16:00 — In-OS full GCC toolchain composes: `cc1 → as → ld → exec` builds *and* runs a C program (`test-gcc` PASS)

**Goal (user):** "commit and push, then continue with the task." The cc1 milestone
was committed/pushed (`a44b88f`). The next GCC self-host step is to prove the real
GCC C frontend and the real binutils backend *compose* in-OS: a C program is
compiled, assembled, linked and **run** entirely on ICS-OS.

**Key realization:** cc1 (and as/ld) are **ICS-OS user-mode binaries** — they link
the SDK runtime (`tccsdk.c posix.c libtcc1.c crt1.c setjmp.c`,
`contrib/gcc/Makefile` line 77) and do all I/O via the `int 0x30` DEX syscall.
`./cc1 --version` on the host prints nothing and file I/O segfaults because
`int 0x30` is undefined under Linux. So cc1/as/ld only work **in-OS**; there is no
host dry-run path (a host link check with host-generated `prog.o` was used only to
validate that the runtime `.o`s resolve `_start`/`puts`/`main`).

**Design:** a new `gctest` console builtin chains four `user_execp()` calls (each
waits), all I/O on `/ramdisk`:
1. stage `gccprobe.c` + the 5 SDK runtime `.o`s to `/ramdisk` via `fcopy` (so the
   spawned tool children never read the CD mid-run — the bintest/selfhost pattern);
2. `cc1 /ramdisk/gccprobe.c -o /ramdisk/gccprobe.s` (C → asm);
3. `as --64 gccprobe.s -o gccprobe.o` (asm → ELF64 obj);
4. `ld gccprobe.o + crt1.o tccsdk.o libtcc1.o posix.o setjmp.o -o gccprobe.exe`
   (obj + SDK runtime → runnable ELF64; default script from `/icsos/apps/ldscripts/`);
5. the kernel `exec`s `gccprobe.exe` → `_start → main → puts("GCC_E2E_OK")`.

The runtime `.o`s are built on the host exactly as `sdk/app.mk` builds every app
(`APP_CFLAGS` + `-Isdk/include`); the default script's `ENTRY(_start)` resolves to
`crt1.o`'s `_start`, so individual `.o`s are linked (not a `.a`, to avoid archive
member-order issues). `gccprobe.c` uses an `extern int puts(...)` declaration (no
`#include`) so cc1 needs no runtime include path yet.

**Result:** `make test-gcc` **PASS**. Log: cc1 (18,180,320 B) compiles
`gccprobe.c`; `as` assembles; `ld` links to a **52,613 B** ELF64; the kernel loads it
(`elf64: loaded /ramdisk/gccprobe.exe entry=0x4001D5`, private PML4, pool used 3)
and runs it → `GCC_E2E_OK` + `GCC_E2E_RUN_OK`.

**Regressions (all PASS):** `test-cc1`, `test-bintools`, `test-integration`
(boot + SMP + exec).

**Files touched:** `kernel/console/console.c` (`gctest` builtin), `ics-os/Makefile`
(`test-gcc` target + `.PHONY`), `docs/gcc-selfhost.md` (rounds + tests).

**Next:** the `gcc` *driver* (front-end: option parsing + `pexecute`/`posix_spawn`
of cc1/as/ld) so a single `gcc x.c -o x` works in-OS; then that GCC compiles ICS-OS.

**Activity now:** `test-gcc` is green — the real GCC C frontend + real binutils
backend compose in-OS to build **and** run a C program. Next: the gcc driver.

### ~15:00 — In-OS GCC `cc1` runs and compiles C: `test-cc1` PASS

**Goal (user):** the staged, compile-only milestone — run the *host-built* GCC
`cc1` (the C frontend, 18 MiB statically-linked ELF64) inside ICS-OS and have it
compile a trivial C file to assembly. `make test-cc1` boots the ISO, stages
`/tmp/icsos-gcc/cc1` as `/icsos/apps/cc1.exe`, runs `cc1test`, and greps for
`CC1_TEST_PASS`.

**Three root causes found and fixed (all blocked the 18 MiB load/run):**

1. **Kernel heap too small for the executable buffer.** `user_execp()` →
   `vfs_mapfile()` allocates the whole ELF into a kernel buffer
   (`malloc(18180320)`) before the ELF loader maps it into user frames. The
   kernel heap was a closed 32 MiB window; with existing heap usage the 18 MiB
   allocation failed (`mapfile: malloc(...)`). Expanded the kernel heap
   32 → **48 MiB** in `memory/memlayout.h` (`MEM_KHEAP_SIZE=0x03000000`,
   `MEM_KHEAP_END=0x05000000`), absorbing the former `kmode` slot
   (`0x04000000..0x05000000`). Removed the `kmode` entry from `mem_reserved[]`
   in `memory/dexmem.c`; `MEM_KMODE_*` now mark the *unreserved* 16 MiB `mempop`
   free-page gap (`0x05000000..0x06000000`), which is preserved. The
   compile-time layout asserts (`kmode after heap`, `userpd after kmode`) still
   hold.

2. **CD-ROM `readfile` allocated a second whole-file buffer.**
   `iso9660_openfile()` did `data_buffer = malloc(2048 * totalblocks)` — a
   *second* ~18 MiB allocation for the whole transfer — DMA-read it in one shot,
   then `memcpy`'d the slice out. For `cc1` that doubled the peak heap need and,
   worse, the oversized single DMA read left the caller's destination **zeroed**
   (the ELF magic came back `00 00 00 00`, so the loader reported
   "unidentified executable format"). Rewrote `iso9660_openfile()` to read the
   CD **one 2048-byte block at a time** directly into the caller's buffer, using
   a tiny per-call `malloc(2048)` and copying the correct slice on the first/last
   partial blocks. This path is shared by all CD reads, so block-at-a-time is now
   the CD baseline (regression-checked with `test-iobench`).

3. **The test drove `cc1` with a driver-only flag.** `cc1test` invoked
   `cc1.exe -c in.c -o out.s`. `-c` (compile+assemble, no link) is a `gcc`
   *driver* option and is **rejected by `cc1`** (`error: command line option
   '-c' is valid for the driver but not for C`). `cc1` is the C frontend and
   emits assembly directly, so the `-c` was dropped: `cc1.exe in.c -o out.s`.

**Result:** `make test-cc1` **PASS**. The 18 MiB ELF64 loads into a private PML4
(`elf64: loaded ... entry=0x109C2B9`), `cc1` runs the real frontend (`Analyzing
compilation unit` → `Performing interprocedural optimizations` → `Assembling
functions: cc1_probe`), and writes `/ramdisk/cc1probe.s` (465 bytes).
`CC1_TEST_PASS`.

**Regressions (all PASS after rebuild):** `test-integration` (boot + SMP + exec),
`test-iobench` (CD sequential + 4 KiB page cache), `test-selfhost` (in-OS TinyCC
compile+run). The host-side `contrib/gnumake`/`contrib/binutils` link errors
(multiple definition of `strcasecmp`/`strncasecmp`/`strsignal`/
`fopen_unlocked`/`bsearch` — SDK `posix.c` vs the staged sources) are
**pre-existing** and the Makefile marks them `(ignored)`; they do not affect the
passing tests above.

**Files touched:** `kernel/memory/memlayout.h` (48 MiB kernel heap),
`kernel/memory/dexmem.c` (dropped `kmode` from `mem_reserved[]`),
`kernel/filesystem/iso9660.c` (block-at-a-time CD read),
`kernel/console/console.c` (`cc1test` command; removed temporary magic/fread
diagnostics), `ics-os/Makefile` (`test-cc1` target).

**Next:** GCC 4.7.4 (C-only) self-host is the stated capstone. Near-term
enablers: (a) fix the pre-existing SDK `posix.c` symbol conflicts so the host
`make.exe`/`ar.exe`/`as.exe`/`ld.exe` link (unblocks running the in-OS toolchain
end-to-end), then (b) drive `cc1` → `as` → `ld` in-OS to produce a real ICS-OS
executable. The memory-map work (48 MiB kernel heap, per-process PML4, userpd
bitmap pool) is in and regression-clean.

**Activity now:** `test-cc1` is green — the host-built GCC `cc1` runs in-OS and
compiles C to assembly. Next: the GCC 4.7.4 self-host chain (close the SDK symbol
conflicts so the binutils/make tools link, then compile+link+run a real ELF in-OS).

## 2026-08-28 (Manila, UTC+8)

### 17:40 — ld (GNU ld 2.23) builds and links: `ld.exe`

**Goal:** the third binutils tool — the GNU linker. `ld` is the last
binutils piece before the GCC 4.7.4 self-host step (GCC emits `.o` via
`as` and needs `ld` to produce the final executable).

**Approach:** mirror the `ar`/`as` recipe. `ld` core = 17 `ld/*.c` files
(the 2.23 `CFILES` + the checked-in generated `ldgram.c`/`ldlex.c`/
`deffilep.c`) plus the `elf_x86_64` emulation, linked against the
already-built libbfd + libiberty + SDK runtime.

**Findings / obstacles:**

- **The emulation is a *generated* file, so it must be committed.**
  Upstream `ld/Makefile.in` produces `eelf_x86_64.c` by running
  `genscripts.sh emulparams/elf_x86_64.sh emultempl/elf.em
  scripttempl/elf.sc` (it inlines the `elf_x86_64` linker script as a C
  string). I ran that script once and committed the result as
  `contrib/binutils/eelf_x86_64.c`, plus a hand-written
  `contrib/binutils/ldemul-list.h` (the one-entry `EMULATION_LIST`). Both
  sit in the `CONFDIR` include dir, which is searched *before*
  `$(SRC)/ld`, so `#include "ldemul-list.h"` (from `ldemul.c`) and
  `#include "eelf_x86_64.c"` (from `ldctor.c`) resolve to our copies.

- **Configure-injected `-D` strings.** `ldmain.c` needs
  `DEFAULT_EMULATION` (the default `emulparams` name), and `ldfile.c`'s
  `find_scripts_dir()` needs `SCRIPTDIR`/`BINDIR`/`TOOLBINDIR`. Upstream
  injects these per-object from `Makefile.in`; we do the same via `LDDEFS`
  in the Makefile (`DEFAULT_EMULATION=\"elf_x86_64\"` must equal the
  emulation's `.name`).

- **`#ifdef` vs `#if 0` trap in config.h.** `ld/sysdep.h` does
  `#ifdef HAVE_DLFCN_H → #include <dlfcn.h>`, and the plugin code is gated
  by `#ifdef ENABLE_PLUGINS`. Those are *definition* tests — a
  `#define HAVE_DLFCN_H 0` still trips `#ifdef` and fails on the missing
  `<dlfcn.h>`. A plugins-off upstream build leaves both macros
  **undefined**, so I removed `#define ENABLE_PLUGINS 0` and
  `#define HAVE_DLFCN_H 0` from `config.h` (documented there).

- **`ldlex.c` must be compiled through `ldlex-wrapper.c`, not directly.**
  The checked-in 2.23 `ldlex.c` includes `bfd.h` with no prior
  `sysdep.h`/`config.h`, but `bfd.h` refuses to parse unless
  `PACKAGE`/`PACKAGE_VERSION` are already defined. `ldlex-wrapper.c` is
  literally `#include "sysdep.h"` + `#include "ldlex.c"` (sysdep.h includes
  config.h first). Upstream `CFILES` lists only `ldlex-wrapper.c` — I had
  also listed `ldlex.c`, which produced a wall of "multiple definition of
  `yy*`/`lex_*`". Removed `ldlex.c` from `LD_C`; a force-include of
  `config.h` is then unnecessary anywhere.

- **`strpbrk` was missing from the SDK** (ld's `ldlang.c` uses it for
  option parsing). Implemented in `sdk/tccsdk.c` (alongside
  `strspn`/`strcspn`) and declared in `sdk/include/string.h`.

- **No C++ demangler in the tree** (no C++ runtime). `demangle-stub.c`
  now also provides `current_demangling_style` (global),
  `cplus_demangle_set_style()` and `cplus_demangle_name_to_style()` —
  `ldlang.c`/`lexsup.c` call these unconditionally for symbol display.
  `demangle.h` is self-contained, so the stub includes it for the exact
  enum.

**Result:** `make ld` compiles all 18 ld objects + `eelf_x86_64.c` and
links `ld.exe` — a statically-linked ELF64 x86-64 **ICS-OS user
executable** (1.28 MB). As with `as.exe`/`ar.exe` it does not run on the
host (it uses `int 0x30` syscalls; `./ld.exe --version` segfaults on the
host, same as `as.exe`) — it is an in-OS tool. Functional in-OS
validation is the next step: a QEMU `test-bintools` that runs
`ar`/`as`/`ld` in-OS (assemble a `.s`, link it, exec the result) against
the FAT `/work` disk, following the `test-spawn`/`test-make` harness
pattern.

**Files touched:** `contrib/binutils/Makefile` (LD_C/LD_EMU/LDDEFS,
`ld` target + compile/link rules), `contrib/binutils/config.h` (dropped
`ENABLE_PLUGINS`/`HAVE_DLFCN_H` defines), `contrib/binutils/ldemul-list.h`
(new), `contrib/binutils/eelf_x86_64.c` (new, generated once),
`contrib/binutils/demangle-stub.c` (3 new symbols), `sdk/tccsdk.c`
(`strpbrk`), `sdk/include/string.h` (prototype),
`docs/gcc-selfhost.md` (ld round).

**Next:** the in-OS `test-bintools` QEMU harness (run as/ar/ld in-OS,
exec the linked output, grep `BINTOOLS_PASS`), then GCC 4.7.4 (C-only).

### 11:27 — libbfd (ELF x86-64) compiles 40/40 against the SDK

**Status:** the in-OS toolchain effort keeps producing results. On top of
libiberty (102/102, see 10:35), the curated **libbfd — 40/40 objects** — now
compiles clean with host gcc against the ICS-OS SDK: the BFD core
(`bfd.c`/`bfdio.c`/`bfdwin.c`/`cache.c`/`opncls.c`/`archures.c`/`targets.c`/
`section.c`/`syms.c`/`reloc.c`/`hash.c`/`linker.c`/`format.c`/`init.c`/
`cpu-i386.c`/...), the archives (`archive.c`/`archive64.c`/`coffgen.c`), and
the **ELF64 x86-64 target** (`elf.c`/`elflink.c` + `elf64.c`/`elf64-gen.c`/
`elf64-x86-64.c` + `elf-strtab.c`/`elf-eh-frame.c`/`elf-attrs.c`/`elf-ifunc.c`)
plus `dwarf2.c`. `make -C ics-os/contrib/binutils libbfd` → "40 objects built
OK". The `ar`/`as`/`ld` tools are next.

**How:** BFD's configure normally *generates* several headers. Instead of
running autotools, I committed the generated headers into `contrib/binutils/`
(found first via `-I`):
- `bfd.h` = the shipped `bfd-in2.h` template with its 5 host-type
  placeholders substituted for a 64-bit host (`file_ptr`/`ufile_ptr` =
  `long`/`unsigned long`, `BFD_ARCH_SIZE`=64, `BFD_DEFAULT_TARGET_SIZE`=64,
  `BFD_SUPPORTS_PLUGINS`=0, `BFD_HOST_64_BIT`=`long`).
- `targmatch.h` = hand-written single-target table (ELF64 x86-64 + l1om/k1om),
  with `&vec` pointer entries matching the real sed output.
- `elf64-target.h`/`elf32-target.h` = `sed s/NN/64|32/` of `elfxx-target.h`.
- `bfdver.h` (version 2.23) and `bfd_stdint.h` (C99 fixed-width typedefs).
`config.h` also gained `DEBUGDIR "/debug"` (dwarf2.c) and no plugins/NLS.

**Gaps this closed:** `strings.h` (new SDK header: `strcasecmp`/`strncasecmp`,
backed by libiberty) was the only missing header — `sysdep.h`'s other includes
(`stdio`/`stdlib`/`string`/`sys/types`/`sys/stat`/`sys/time`/`time`/`unistd`/
`fcntl`/`errno`) all existed. The libbfd build was otherwise clean against the
SDK, confirming the libiberty-round gap list was comprehensive.

**Next (in order):**
1. Build **`ar`** (uses libbfd archive + libiberty) into a static ELF64 `.exe`;
   then **`as`** (gas) and **`ld`**.
2. Stage `ar`/`as`/`ld` on `/work`; in-OS `test-bintools`: `ar rcs` +
   `as prog.s` + `ld -o prog.exe` + exec `prog.exe` → PASS.
3. Regressions (`test-integration`/`test-spawn`/`test-make`) + commit.

**Files touched:** `contrib/binutils/{Makefile,config.h,bfd.h,bfdver.h,
bfd_stdint.h,targmatch.h,elf64-target.h,elf32-target.h}`, `sdk/include/
strings.h`, `docs/gcc-selfhost.md`, this blog.

### 10:35 — libiberty builds 102/102 against the SDK (first real gap list)

**Status:** the in-OS toolchain effort (see 09:35 pivot) is producing its first
concrete results. `contrib/binutils/` (config.h + Makefile overlay, no
autotools) now compiles the entire curated **libiberty** — **102/102 objects** —
with host gcc against the ICS-OS SDK headers (`-nostdinc -I sdk/include`,
`-DHAVE_CONFIG_H`). libbfd and the as/ld/ar tools are next.

**How it works:** the Makefile compiles each libiberty source with the SDK
include tree first (so SDK headers win over host libc), our `config.h`
(`-I contrib/binutils`), and the binutils include trees; objects go to
`/tmp/icsos-binutils/obj`. The SDK is the authoritative type source, so
`config.h` deliberately does **not** re-typedef `mode_t`/`pid_t`/etc. (early
builds failed on `mode_t` conflicts until that was removed).

**OS gaps this closed (the "gap list" the pivot promised):**
- **New SDK headers:** `float.h` (IEEE float limits), `sys/param.h`
  (`PATH_MAX`/`PAGE_SIZE`/`MAXPATHLEN`/`MIN`/`MAX`/`roundup`), `sys/resource.h`
  (`struct rlimit`, `RLIMIT_*`), `malloc.h` (legacy shim over `stdlib.h`).
- **C99 types:** added `intmax_t`/`uintmax_t` + 64-bit limits to `sdk/include/
  stdint.h` (binutils `strtoumax`, `PRIxMAX` need them).
- **`signal.h`:** added `sigset_t`, `sigaction`, `SA_*`, and `sig*`/`raise`
  prototypes (libiberty `sigsetmask.c`, ld job control).
- **`fcntl.h`:** added `F_DUPFD`/`F_GETFD`/`F_SETFD`/`F_GETFL`/`F_SETFL` and
  `FD_CLOEXEC` (libiberty `pex-unix.c`; libbfd may use `fcntl`).
- **`unistd.h`:** added `realpath`, `sysconf`, `getpagesize`, `pathconf` and
  the `_SC_*`/`_PC_*` names (libbfd `getpagesize`, ld `realpath`,
  `pathconf(_PC_PATH_MAX)`).
- **`errno.h`:** added `ENAMETOOLONG`, `ELOOP`, `EISDIR`, `ENOTEMPTY`, `EPIPE`,
  `ESRCH`, `EDEADLK`.
- **`posix.c` implementations:** `getpagesize` (4096), `sysconf` (`_SC_PAGESIZE`,
  `_SC_CLK_TCK`=100, `_SC_NPROCESSORS_*`=1), `pathconf` (`_PC_PATH_MAX`/
  `_PC_NAME_MAX`), lexical `realpath`, in-SDK `getrlimit`/`setrlimit`
  (default unlimited, `RLIMIT_NOFILE`=256), and POSIX signal-set ops
  (`sigemptyset`/`sigfillset`/`sigaddset`/`sigdelset`/`sigismember`/
  `sigprocmask`/`raise`). All userspace-only — **no new kernel syscalls**.
  `posix.c` re-verified to compile cleanly under the SDK flags.

**Decisions:** libiberty files with no consumer in as/ld/ar, or that would
duplicate an SDK symbol (`gettimeofday.c`, `getpagesize.c`, `lrealpath.c`), are
excluded from the build list. `config.h` sets `HAVE_STDDEF_H`/`HAVE_STDLIB_H`/
`HAVE_SYS_PARAM_H`/`HAVE_SYS_RESOURCE_H`/`HAVE_FLOAT_H`/`HAVE_GETPAGESIZE`/
`HAVE_SYSCONF`/`HAVE_PATHCONF`/`HAVE_GETRLIMIT`/`HAVE_SETRLIMIT`/`HAVE_TIME_H`
so libiberty/libbfd gate the right includes.

**Next (in order):**
1. Implement/verify the `fcntl(F_GETFD/F_SETFD/F_GETFL)` kernel side so
   libbfd's file handling is correct (SDK `fcntl` is currently a stub returning
   0).
2. Build **libbfd** (ELF x86-64 subset) against the SDK; close its gaps.
3. Build `ar` (then `as`, then `ld`) into `apps/`; stage on `/work`.
4. In-OS `test-bintools`: `ar rcs` + `as prog.s` + `ld` link + exec → PASS.
5. Regressions (`test-integration`/`test-spawn`/`test-make`) + commit.

**Files touched:** `contrib/binutils/{Makefile,config.h}`, `sdk/include/
{float.h,sys/param.h,sys/resource.h,malloc.h,stdint.h,signal.h,fcntl.h,
unistd.h,errno.h}`, `sdk/posix.c`, this blog.

### 09:35 — Pivot: host-built toolchain self-build (Phase 1: binutils)

**Direction change (user):** drop the TCC bootstrap. The capstone goal is for
ICS-OS to self-host a **GCC build**, and the way to find every OS gap that
blocks it is to run the real toolchain in-OS. Host Linux `gcc`/`make`/`ld`/`as`/
`ar` can't run here as-is (glibc + Linux syscalls), so "host-compiled" means
**rebuilt by the host toolchain against the ICS-OS SDK** — the same, already
proven pattern as `apps/make.exe`.

**Phase 1 (this round):** build host-gcc `as`/`ld`/`ar` (binutils) + the already
working `make` targeting the SDK; ship them on the `/work` disk; in-OS: `ar rcs`,
`as prog.s`, `ld` link, exec the result. Every missing POSIX piece surfaced is a
documented OS gap to close (getcwd/stat/access/unlink/rename/time/...). This is
the gap-closing engine for the eventual GCC self-build.

**Also this session (GPF64):** `GPFhandler64` no longer halts the VM on a
**user** fault — it dumps RIP/CR2/regs, then `exc_recover()` (kill child +
resume parent + set `dex32_child_faulted`), mirroring the page-fault path.
Kernel faults still halt. `makeboot` now runs the TCC-linked `/work/make.exe`
first, captures its `rip=0x8` fault, and falls back to the host-gcc make so
`test-make` stays green. This fault-capture is the diagnostic that found the
TCC-linked make GPFs at startup (entry `0x43FC4F` → `call *%rax` with `rax=0`).

### 07:35 — Green `make test-make`: POSIX `wait()` for GNU make

**Current problem:** `test-make` hung 1800 s. In-OS TinyCC compiled make
(`MAKE_TCC_OK`) and make posix_spawned `/work/hello.exe` (load OK,
`entry=0x4040C6`) but the child never ran and make never reaped it.

**Root cause:** GNU make's blocking job path calls `wait(&status)` (the
legacy DEX `0xC` → `dex32_wait`), not `waitpid`. `dex32_wait` is a
spin-wait on the `childwait` flag that never switches the CPU to the
child, so the child starves; it also returns a bogus `1` and ignores the
status pointer. `test-spawn` worked because it calls `waitpid` (`0xB1`),
which does `ps_switchto(child)` directly.

**Fix:** SDK `wait()` is now POSIX-correct — `int wait(int *status)`
delegates to `waitpid(-1, status, 0)` (`sdk/tccsdk.c`); prototype added to
`sdk/include/sys/wait.h`. No kernel change; `0xC` stays mapped for DEX
compat.

Also found and fixed a **committed syntax error**: stray `mar         }`
in `sys_waitpid` (`kernel/vfs/posixfd.c:904`) — the kernel in the tree
did not compile at all; every prior ISO booted a stale binary.

**Tests:** `test-make` PASS (`MAKE_TCC_OK`, `Hello World from ICS-OS!`,
`MAKE_PASS`). Regressions `test-boot`, `test-smp`, `test-exec`,
`test-integration`, `test-spawn`, `test-selfhost` all PASS. `test-tccboot`
fails **pre-existing** (`tcc: error: invalid option -- '-nostdlib'` from
the in-OS-rebuilt tccnew) — A/B verified identical with the `tccsdk.c`
change reverted, so not a regression.

**Activity now:** `test-make` green. Next: the tcc-linked `make.exe`
still GPFs at `rip=0x8` (a `call` through a near-null pointer, i.e. a
corrupted/uninitialized function pointer — the "mixed in-OS-tcc +
host-gcc `sdkobj/`" class, same as tccnew). Two constraints for the
next session: (1) the GPF64 handler **halts the VM**
(`kernel/hardware/exceptions.c` `GPFhandler64` -> `while(1){}`), so an
in-OS run of the tcc-linked make just hangs — capture the fault with a
non-halting dump (record RIP/CR2/RAX/RSP + set the child-faulted flag
and return) or (2) build make **fully with in-OS tcc** (including the
SDK) so there are no mixed objects — currently blocked because in-OS tcc
chokes on the raw SDK headers (`va_list`/`size_t` clashes), which is why
`sdkobj/` is host-gcc. Fix whichever unblocks makeboot running the
in-OS-built make.

### 03:30 — GNU make 3.82 bootstrap (TinyCC → make)

**Current problem:** GNU make needs POSIX extras (dirent, waitpid(-1), posix_spawn
recipes) and an in-OS compile onto `/work`.

**Activity now:** Host gcc links make against the SDK. Host `tcc -E` preprocesses
sources so in-OS tcc never parses SDK headers (`__va_arg` builtin clash). Dropped
the `__va_arg` prototype from `sdk/include/stdarg.h`. `makeboot` extracts
`makesrc.tar` onto FAT `/work`, compiles 26 files, links `make.exe` (`MAKE_TCC_OK`).
The TinyCC-linked binary GPFs at `rip=0x8` (mixed tcc/gcc objects); the recipe
run uses host-gcc `apps/make.exe` until that link is fixed. Next: green
`make test-make`, then tcc-linked runtime.

### 02:40 — POSIX spawn + virtio `/work` (GCC self-host prerequisites)

TinyCC will not compile `kernel32.c`. The self-host target is TinyCC → GNU
make → binutils → GCC 4.7.4 (C only) → ICS-OS. This round does not download
GCC; it lands the OS gaps that block that chain.

**Current problem:** no userspace `waitpid`, `execvp` was a stub, `user_execp`
always waits (console/tccboot need that), `forkprocess` is 32-bit paging,
`/ramdisk` is 16 MiB, and `vblk` was raw with no FAT mount.

**Activity now:** GNU make 3.82 bootstrap. `waitpid(-1)`/`WNOHANG` wait queue +
`getdents`/`dirent` are in. `contrib/gnumake/` + `scripts/stage-make.sh`.
Need a green `test-make` next (in-OS tcc of make onto `/work`). Stale
`scheduler.o` after PCB growth hung boot — `process.h` is now a scheduler
dep.

## 2026-08-28 (Manila, UTC+8) — continued

### 03:05 — GNU make bootstrap (TinyCC → make)

Spawn prerequisites are in. Next is in-OS TinyCC compiling GNU make,
then binutils, then GCC 4.7.4.

## 2026-08-27 (Manila, UTC+8)

### 21:15 — Async virtio completions into io_uring

IRQ harvest of the virtio used ring replaces the 20M `pause` spin.
Each in-flight request owns a 3-descriptor slot (hdr + data + status)
plus a 4KiB kernel bounce buffer (user VA is not GPA-safe under a
private PML4). Waiters `hlt` until MSI-X 0x42; copy-back and uring CQEs
run in process context. `/dev/vblk` is a raw POSIX fd; uring
READ/WRITE/FSYNC on it submit without waiting. `io_uring_enter` honors
`min_complete`. Ramdisk SQEs stay inline.

Tests: `test-virtio` (`irqs=3 slots=42`, `VIRTIO_IRQ_OK`, pipelined
reads), `test-posixio` (`URING_VBLK_PASS`), `test-boot`, `test-smp`,
`test-exec` PASS.

**Activity now:** async uring on virtio is in. Next is `test-kbuild` or
ring-3.

### 20:40 — I/O P3: POSIX fds and a synchronous io_uring subset

Kernel per-process fd table: `open`/`close`/`read`/`write`/`lseek`/
`preadv`/`pwritev`/`fsync`. `io_uring_setup`/`enter` run NOP, READ/WRITE,
READV/WRITEV, FSYNC, OPENAT, CLOSE inline into the CQ. Ring VA is
`params.sq_off.user_addr` (identity map). DEX fopen/fread stay as compat;
`fdopen` returns the kernel `file_PCB*` so TinyCC ELF output still uses
DEX `fwrite`.

Tests: `test-boot`, `test-smp`, `test-exec`, `test-virtio`, `test-iobench`,
`test-posixio`, `test-selfhost` PASS (`POSIXIO_PASS`, `URING_PASS`).

**Activity now:** P3 landed. Next is async uring completions or
`test-kbuild`.

### 20:15 — I/O P2: bio + 4KiB page cache

P2 is in. 512×4KiB write-back cache, `bio_submit_sync`, one hctx per
device. ISO9660 CD reads are cached (two 2048-byte sectors per page).
Misses merge into aligned 4KiB device reads.

Tests: `test-integration`, `test-virtio`, `test-iobench` PASS.
iobench on `/icsos/apps/tcc.exe`: cold 224 ms, warm 3 ms (**74.6x**),
cache hits=580 misses=146 fills=74 merged=148, `IOBENCH_CACHE_OK`.

**Activity now:** P2 landed. Next is P3 (POSIX fds / io_uring) or
`test-kbuild`.

### 19:50 — Memory map: one table, no more clobber-by-growth

The 0x200000 frame-stack collision was the same class of bug as the
userpd owner-table-in-BSS hang: magic PAs that the kernel image grows
into. Layout is now `kernel/memory/memlayout.h`.

- Linker `ASSERT(bssEnd <= 0x3C0000)` — kernel stays below TinyCC's
  4MiB ELF window; frame stack sits in the remainder.
- Kernel dispatcher/sched/PF stacks moved into `.bss` (same as AP
  stacks). No more 0x2800000 island.
- `mempop` seeds [4MiB, 128MiB) minus a reserved-range table. Adding a
  region means adding one table entry.
- Kernel heap is a closed 32MiB window at 32–64MiB; `sbrk` identity-
  bumps `knext` and must not `mempop` (that leaked frames and let the
  heap walk out of a 4MiB hole).
- kexec staging moved to 16–32MiB. `sharedmem` moved out of the userpd
  pool (it sat at 0x7000000 inside 96–128MiB).

`test-boot`, `test-exec`, `test-virtio`, `test-iobench` PASS.

**Activity now:** layout is the source of truth. Next still P2 blk-mq or
kbuild.

### 19:30 — I/O P0 green, P1 virtio-blk green

P0 tests: `test-boot`, `test-exec`, `test-iobench` PASS. iobench
cold/warm on the CD is still ~1.1x (ISO path bypasses blkcache);
the target is a regression oracle, not a cache proof.

P1: modern virtio-pci + virtio-blk (`vblk`). One DMA request queue,
MSI-X vector 0x42, 512-byte LBAs, FEATURES_OK + DRIVER_OK. Self-test
writes/reads the last sector. `test-virtio` PASS:
`capacity=16384 sectors msix=1` and `VIRTIO_BLK_OK`. ATA PIO stays as
the non-VM fallback.

**Hang along the way:** adding `virtio_blk.o` grew kernel `.bss` past
`0x200000`, which was the free-page stack. `mempop()` metadata was
clobbered → boot stuck at `Initializing the device manager...` (first
`malloc` after `extension_init` uses a second sbrk). Fix: place the
frame stack just after linker `bssEnd`. PCI MMIO is marked PCD|PWT;
`dex32_restore_identity_map` reapplies those bits so exec does not
turn BARs write-back again.

**Activity now:** P0+P1 landed. Next is P2 (blk-mq lite + 4KiB page
cache) or `test-kbuild`.

### 18:00 — I/O P0: drop the global lock across device I/O

Approved plan: unlock the hot path before virtio. `dex32_requestIO` no
longer holds `IOrequest_busy` or `disable_taskswitching()` during
`read_block`/`write_block`. Per-device `io_devlock[]` still serializes
ATA PIO. `IOrequest.lba` is `u64`. `disk_mgr` `sleep(1)+hlt`; fclose
calls `iomgr_request_flush()`. `test-iobench` is a real QEMU target again.

**Activity now:** build kernel, `make test-boot test-exec test-iobench`.

### 17:50 — I/O architecture review

Reviewed the live I/O path (VFS → FAT/ISO → iosched → ATA PIO / UHCI
poll). It is still a 2003 single-queue, global-lock, busy-wait design.
disk_mgr is a safety-net flusher because inline `dex32_requestIO` was
required to avoid priority starvation.

Recommended path: unlock completions (P0), virtio-blk as the VM disk
(P1), blk-mq lite + 4 KiB page cache (P2), POSIX fds then io_uring (P3).
Keep FAT/ISO; do not invent a new on-disk FS first.

**Activity now:** architecture review delivered; kbuild kernel32.c
compile remains the self-host blocker.

### 15:30 — `test-tccboot` PASS

Root cause was not `s==NULL` in main. Static TinyCC EXEs still emit a
`.plt`; `fill_got()` never wrote `R_X86_64_JUMP_SLOT` / `GLOB_DAT` into
the GOT, so `call tcc_new@plt` jumped to **rip=0** (`rcx=1` from
`stdout`). Layout-dependent: some links used PC32 (old GPF in the files
loop) and some used PLT (rip=0).

Fix in `tccelf.c`:
- set `attr->got_offset` on PLT GOT entries
- `fill_got()` walks `.got->reloc` and writes `sym->st_value` into each
  JUMP_SLOT/GLOB_DAT slot

Also: `tcc.c` reloads `s` from `tcc_state` after calls; `dexsdk.h`
`size_t` is `unsigned long` on x86_64; `contrib/tcc/Makefile` depends on
`tccelf.c` (ONE_SOURCE was not rebuilding).

`test-tccboot` PASS: tccnew compiles C `main` and `min.c` (inline asm
`_start`). `test-selfhost` PASS with KVM (TCG 256M timed out in waitpid).

### 16:00 — kbuild untar: FAT 8.3 folded `ATA` to `ata`

`test-kbuild` died extracting `ksrc.tar`:
`error locating directory` on `/ramdisk/k/hardware/ATA/ataiopio.c`
right after `hardware/hardware.h` succeeded.

FAT `file12tostr()` lowercases 8.3 names into the VFS node, so mkdir
`ATA` became `ata`. `vfs_searchname` used `strcmp`, so the parent of
`ataiopio.c` was not found. Names longer than 8.3 (`irqhandlers.c`)
would also vanish on create.

Fixes:
- keep original VFS names on FAT create
- case-insensitive path walk; prefer directories when more components remain
- ramdisk clusters 2KiB (64 dirents) so `hardware/ATA` is not capped at 16
- skip VFS-illegal tar names (`system design.txt`); drop `docs/` from ksrc.tar
- stage `aptramp.o` (ISO9660 8.3 cannot store `ap_trampoline.o` without Joliet)

Untar + kasm copy now succeed. `test-kbuild` then spent 30 min at
`kbuild: compiling kernel C` and was SIGTERM'd (QEMU stdout fully
buffered, so TinyCC progress was invisible). Next: line-buffered QEMU,
compile `tcccompat.c` first, then the unity-build `kernel32.c`.

**Activity now:** diagnose in-OS tcc compile of kernel32.c.

### 14:10 — tccnew #GP: `s` lost across calls (s==NULL at files loop)

Commit `1fe0548` is on `ics-os-v2`. Next blocker is still `test-tccboot`.

In-OS `tccnew` #GPs at `s->filetype = f->type` (`rip=0x401ee6`) with
**`rax=0x4e8`** (`offsetof(TCCState, filetype)` when `s==NULL`) and
**`rcx=0xf000ff0000000000`** (kernel leftover / non-canonical filespec).
Bytes at `0x401ecc` are the filespec walk (`add %rdx,%rcx; mov (%rcx),%rax`).
`tcc_parse_args` ran (otherwise we would not reach that loop); the
TCCState pointer was not in the stack slot main reloads.

Likely TinyCC 0.9.27 left `s` in a caller-saved register across
`tcc_parse_args` / `tcc_set_output_type`. Those run long enough for a
timer IRQ at CPL0.

Fixes in flight:
- `tcc.c`: spill `s` to `.bss` (`tcc_main_state`) and reload after calls
- `x86_64-gen.c`: 128-byte frame pad so CPL0 IRQ frames cannot overlap
  rbp-relative locals
- `dexsdk.h`: `size_t` is `unsigned long` on x86_64 (was `unsigned int`)

**Activity now:** rebuild `tcc.exe`, `make test-tccboot`.

### 12:50 — tccnew still #GP; 4K PT_LOAD is not the remaining bug

`test-selfhost` still PASSes (until a later `context_load` experiment).
`test-tccboot` still FAILs at `tccnew` compiling `min.c`.

What we proved:
- TinyCC 2MiB `ELF_PAGE_SIZE` *did* collide with the user stack. Default is
  now 4KiB; tccnew PT_LOADs sit at `0x400000` / `0x44A370`, well below the
  96MiB reserved window. `args.exe` (TCC-linked + gcc SDK) runs.
- crt1 relocs in tccnew are sane: `getparameters=0x441CB4`, `strtok=0x441D3A`,
  `main=0x401A03`. GPF RIP `0x401ee6` is **inside TinyCC `main`**, ~739 bytes
  in, with `rsp=0x0dffebe0` (valid stack) and **`rcx=0xf000ff0000000000`**
  (non-canonical). `tcc-main` printf never prints, so it dies before that
  line (likely loading a string/GOT pointer).
- Zeroing caller-saved GPRs in `context_load` broke `min.exe` exec (hung
  at `execp: started pid`). Reverted.

Still open: why TinyCC-generated `main` loads a non-canonical pointer.
`test-kbuild` / `test-fullhost` remain blocked on tccboot.

**Activity now:** reverted `context_load` GPR wipe; next is GOT/.rodata reloc
in the in-OS-linked tccnew.

### 08:30 — userpd pool leak (tccboot blocker)

`test-tccboot` compiles every TinyCC file and links `tccnew.exe`, then GPFs:
`GPF64: rip=0x449ad0 cr2=0xa2f2000 proc=/ramdisk/tccnew.exe`.

Root cause: the 32MiB per-process frame pool (`[0x06000000,0x08000000)`) is
exhausted after ~5 `tcc.exe` runs. Later execs fall back to the shared
identity map (`elf64: map fail image` / `userpd map failed; shared map`).
`tccnew` then touches heap at `0xa2f2000` (past the 2MiB commit) on that
shared map and GPFs.

`userpd_free()` existed but did not actually return frames:
1. The 4-level walker could miss leaves (2MiB PS vs 4KiB PTE tables).
2. `freelinearloc()`/`getphys()` (now a real 4-level walk) `mempush()`'d
   pool frames onto the kernel free-page stack — stealing them from
   `upop()` even if the walker later ran.
3. `kill_process` gated reclaim on `ACCESS_USER` and a pointer compare
   to `pagedir1`.

Fix (standard frame-allocator practice):
- Owner bitmap: every `upop()` is billed to the owning PML4; process
  exit scans and returns **all** billed frames. No walk required.
- `freelinearloc` skips pool frames (they are not `mempop` memory).
- `kill_process` always `userpd_free`s a pool PML4 (threads share it).
- Map each ELF `PT_LOAD` separately (do not privately map TinyCC's
  2MiB `.data` alignment gap).
- `ELF_HEAP_COMMIT` 8MiB so `tccnew` min.c does not depend on the first
  sbrk/PF for `0xa2f2000`.
- `invlpg` after splitting a 2MiB identity page; stop `sbrk` from
  `memset`ing the user VA through a stale large-page TLB.

Measured after the zombie_free fix (`test-selfhost`): pool returns to
**0/8192** after every exec; PML4 `0x7FFF000` is reused.

`tccnew` then got a private PML4 but #GP(0) at `rip=0x401ecc` on
`movsbl (%rcx),%edx` (strcpy) with **rcx=0xf000ff0000000000** (non-canonical)
and **rax=0xe000194** (just above `userstackloc` 0x0E000000). TinyCC's
default 2MiB section alignment placed later PT_LOADs on the user stack
window. Link with `-Wl,-section-alignment=1000`. Also `relocate_plt()`
for static EXE that still have a `.plt`.

**Activity now:** `make test-tccboot` with 4K section alignment, then kbuild/fullhost.

### 07:30 — Self-compile / self-host: evaluate, plan, then fix

**Goals (user):**
1. ICS-OS compiles itself *inside itself* and **boots** that compiled OS.
2. ICS-OS compiles its own compiler inside itself, then uses that compiler to compile itself inside itself.

**Measured state at start of this session (not the 2026-08-22 gap analysis):**

| Capability | Target | State |
|---|---|---|
| Host kernel + `tcc.exe` | `make -C kernel bzImage`, `make apps` | PASS |
| In-OS compile+run C | `test-selfhost` | PASS (`min.c`/`hello.c`) |
| In-OS rebuild TinyCC | `test-tccboot` | FAIL — double fault during `tccgen.c` exec (`DBLFLT cr2=0xa194000`) |
| In-OS compile kernel | `test-kbuild` | logic exists; flags incomplete; **never boots** the image |
| Compiler-then-kernel | `test-fullhost` | blocked by tccboot |
| Boot in-OS kernel | none | **not implemented** (kbuild only checks ELF magic) |

**Root causes still open:**
1. `getphys()` on x86_64 **lies** (always returns identity\|present). A real user PF (unmapped heap page after a 2MiB identity block is split) is treated as present, the dump path runs on the user CR3, and the PF handler itself faults → **double fault**. This is the tccboot blocker.
2. Double-fault wrapper printed a **stack slot address**, not RIP (`leaq` vs `movq`).
3. `syscall` MSRs written with WRMSR but **EDX never set** (STAR/LSTAR garbage high half). `syscallentry` IRETQ frame is **backwards** (RIP/CS/RFLAGS) and discards the return value via POP_ALL.
4. ELF loader maps `SYSCALL_STACK` (64KiB) then `createprocess` uses `USER_SYSCALL_STACK` (512KiB) — splitting the 2MiB syscall block leaves most of it unmapped.
5. kbuild omits host flags; no kexec/boot loop; ramdisk 8MiB is tight for tccboot+kbuild together.

**Plan (execute in this session):**
1. Fix diagnostics + `getphys` 4-level walk + demand-map missing user pages + reentrant PF/DF handlers.
2. Fix WRMSR + `syscallentry` (Linux ABI → DEX) so in-OS `tccnew.exe` can use `syscall` if it does.
3. Map the full syscall stack; grow ramdisk (16MiB) and ELF heap (16MiB); fail closed if `userpd_map_region` runs out of frames.
4. kexec: load ELF64 to a staging area, trampoline copies it over 0x100000, drop to 32-bit protected mode, jump to `startup` with Multiboot2 (`kexeced` cmdline). Stamp `build_id` so the second boot is distinguishable.
5. kbuild uses the stamp + kexec; tests assert the **new** kernel's `Root mount [OK]`.
6. `test-tccboot` then `test-kbuild` then `test-fullhost`.

**Activity now:** implementing (1)–(4).

## 2026-08-23 (Manila, UTC+8)

### 19:00–20:30 — "Boot sometimes hangs at a different point every time" (DIAGNOSTIC MODE)

Task: boot is non-deterministic — sometimes it stops in `taskswitcher()`
(`sw=0`, `cur=dex_kernel`), sometimes it dies right after `extension:
changing schedulers..`, sometimes it goes further. Identify and fix the
root cause so the in-OS TinyCC self-host boot path is reachable.

Method: instrumented with serial diagnostics (switch counter + ready-list
dump in `ps_switchto`, `TIMER=` heartbeat in `schedule_from_timer`,
`sigwait`/`ticks`/`processmgr_busy`/`ctx_load_in_progress` GDB probes) and
used QEMU + `gdb` (`(gdb) target remote 127.0.0.1:1234`) to capture the
exact CPU state at hang time. GDB backtraces were decisive.

### 20:30–21:15 — ROOT CAUSE #1: BSS is never zeroed (THE bug)

GDB proved the freeze was an infinite busy-wait in
`sync_entercrit(&processmgr_busy)` (extension.c:73), reached via
`ps_scheduler_install()` inside `process_init()` (process.c:2151):

```
#0 lapic_read / #5 getprocessid / #6 sync_entercrit (spin: var->busy != 0)
#7 extension_override / #8 ps_scheduler_install / #9 process_init
   ticks = 0 (timer never started), processmgr_busy.busy = 0x9CE000 (garbage)
```

`startup.S` never zeroed the NOBITS `.bss` region (GRUB only loads through
`dataEnd`), so every uninitialized global held stale RAM. `processmgr_busy`
was garbage, and `process_init` only zeroed it *after* `ps_scheduler_install()`
already called `sync_entercrit()` on it → `while (var->busy && var->busy !=
getprocessid())` never terminates. Whether it hangs depends on stale RAM /
stack depth → different spot every run. **This is the non-deterministic
boot hang.**

Fixes (both, defense in depth):
- `startup.S`: zero the C-global BSS region **before `call main`**.
  Gotchas hit along the way: (a) `.bss` also contains the *in-use* boot
  page tables (`boot_pml4..boot_pd3`, CR3 points here) and the boot stack
  (`0x150000..0x160000`) — zeroing from `dataEnd` destroyed paging and
  killed boot instantly; the loop must start at `boot_stack_top`.
  (b) `movq boot_stack_top, %rsi` (no `$`) is a *memory load*, not a
  constant — GDB caught the CPU stuck in the loop with garbage bounds;
  it must be `movabs $boot_stack_top, %rsi`.
- `process.c`: explicitly zero `processmgr_busy` *before*
  `ps_scheduler_install()` (the old zeroing was after).

Result: boot now reliably passes the previously-deadlocking scheduler
install and reaches the in-OS TinyCC compile.

### 21:15–21:35 — ROOT CAUSE #2: `ready_lock` was not IRQ-safe

With boot fixed, the next hang was a **spinlock re-entrancy deadlock**
caught by GDB in the timer IRQ:

```
#0 spin_lock(&ready_lock)  <- spinning
#1 scheduler()             (scheduler.c:49)
#2 bridges_link / #3 schedule_from_timer / #4 timerwrapper (IRQ)
```

`spinlock` is a plain test-and-set with no interrupt protection.
`scheduler()`/`sched_enqueue()`/`sched_dequeue()` are reached from the
timer IRQ (IF=0) *and* from voluntary `taskswitch()`/`waitpid` paths
(IF=1). A timer IRQ landing inside an outer (IF-enabled) hold of
`ready_lock` re-enters `scheduler()` and spins forever.

Fix: `scheduler.c` — wrap each `ready_lock` critical section in
`storeflags`/`stopints` … `spin_unlock`/`restoreflags` so the lock is
always held with interrupts disabled (IRQ-safe).

### 21:35–22:00 — ROOT CAUSE #3 (build system): stale `kernel32.o`

`kernel32.c` `#include`s ~40 `.c` files (incl. `process/process.c`,
`process/sync.c`, `devmgr/extension.c`, `dexapi/dex32API.c`), but the
`kernel32.o:` Makefile rule only listed a tiny subset of them as
prerequisites. So edits to those included files were **never recompiled** —
the tested binary stayed stale (heartbeat string still present in
`Kernel64.bin` after editing `process.c` proved it). This masked the
`process.c` fixes and made boot look "the same".

Fix: `kernel/Makefile` — added all `#include`d `.c` files to the
`kernel32.o` prerequisites. Verified: `touch process/process.c` now
rebuilds `kernel32.o` and relinks.

### State after fixes

Boot is now **deterministic** and reaches the in-OS TinyCC compile:
`tccboot` extracts `/ramdisk/tcc`, loads `tcc.exe`, `createprocess`
succeeds, the child is scheduled and the timer keeps firing (thousands of
ticks). Remaining (separate, deterministic) issue — *not* the reported
non-deterministic boot hang: `tcc.exe`'s first file
`open("/icsos/pre/tcc.c")` enters a voluntary
`iso9660_loaddirectory()` → `taskswitch()` polling loop (iso9660.c:49) that
never completes, so the compile does not finish. This is a distinct
disk/ISO9660 read-completion bug and the natural next investigation.

Files changed: `kernel/startup/startup.S`, `kernel/process/process.c`,
`kernel/process/scheduler.c`, `kernel/Makefile`.

### 22:00–01:30 — Self-host pipeline: I/O deadlock → red-zone corruption → full per-file compile

Continuing from the "iso9660 read-completion" lead. Booting the
`tccboot` ISO under KVM (`-smp 1`, 1 GB) and grepping the serial log
showed boot stalling right after `Initializing the disk manager...` —
the CD `reading primary volume descriptor` never appeared.

**ROOT CAUSE #4: disk-manager starvation deadlock.** `disk_mgr` is the
only thread that executes block reads, created by `createkthread()` at
priority 0; user processes get priority 1 (`createprocess`). A user
process blocked in `open()`/`read()` polls `dex32_IOcomplete()` in a
`taskswitch()` loop — but the priority scheduler always re-selects the
runnable priority-1 user process over the priority-0 `disk_mgr`, so the
queued CD/HD read never runs and boot deadlocks.
Two wrong fixes tried and reverted (both regressed boot — stalled
*earlier*, at the disk-manager stage):
1. raise `disk_mgr` to priority 1 (equal to user) — no effect;
2. make `disk_mgr` blocking (`sleep(1)` when idle) + priority 2 —
   boot stalled even earlier. Lesson: don't touch the worker's
   priority/idle loop; the busy-poll worker must keep its scheduling
   relationship with the priority-0 boot path.

**Fix (committed `d2b43fb`):** `kernel/iomgr/iosched.c` — extract the
per-request read/write into `iomgr_execjob()` and call it
**synchronously from `dex32_requestIO()` in the caller's context**
(ints stopped, `IOrequest_busy` held, task-switching disabled). The
request completes before the caller polls, so no worker is needed on
the hot path; `disk_mgr` remains a safety-net queue drain + flusher at
its original priority. This is the standard synchronous block-I/O /
blocking work-queue model and removes the dependency on worker
scheduling entirely.
Verified: boot now reaches `Root mount [OK]`, `tccboot` extracts the
full TinyCC source to `/ramdisk`, and the in-OS `tcc.exe` compiles
files `[0]..[8]`.

**ROOT CAUSE #5: in-OS `tcc.exe` red-zone corruption (bogus
"field not found").** File `[9] i386asm.c` failed with
`i386asm.c:3980: error: field not found: instr_type` — but `instr_type`
*is* a field of `ASMInstr` (the struct definition and the `pa`
declaration are both in the preprocessed source and trivially valid).
Proof the compiler source was innocent: build the *identical*
`contrib/tcc` source on the host (host libc, `-DONE_SOURCE
-DCONFIG_TCC_STATIC`) → `/tmp/tcc_host`, then compile the very same
preprocessed `i386asm.c`: **exit 0, clean object**. (The prebuilt
`tcc.exe` cannot run on the host — it uses `int $0x30` DEX syscalls —
so a host-runnable build of the same source was the only way to
differential-test.)

Mechanism: `tcc.exe` is built by gcc with the default 128-byte red
zone (`sdk/app.mk` lacked `-mno-red-zone`). It runs at ring 0 in kernel
CS; on every `int 0x30`/IRQ the CPU pushes the 40-byte hardware frame
onto the *user* RSP, then `syscallwrapper` does `PUSH_ALL` (120 bytes)
on the same RSP (`kernel/irqwrap.S`), overwriting the red zone
`[RSP-128, RSP)` where gcc keeps live spilled values. Every syscall
from tcc silently destroyed red-zone data; on the biggest file
(i386asm.c — most syscalls, longest compile) it finally corrupted
compiler state and surfaced as a bogus semantic error. (This is the
latent bug flagged in `docs/selfhost-gap-analysis.md` §2.4.)

**Fix (committed `d9c7abd`):** add `-mno-red-zone` to `APP_CFLAGS` in
`sdk/app.mk` (matches the kernel's own build flags). Rebuilt
`tcc.exe`; in-OS it now compiles **all 10** TinyCC files including
`i386asm.c`, and `tccboot` proceeds to the `tccnew.exe` link step.

**Link-step fix (committed `6e5f2d4`).** The link command compiles the
raw SDK sources (`tccsdk.c`, `posix.c`, `crt1.c`, ...) with no include
paths → `include file 'dexsdk.h' not found`. Fixed:
`stage-tcc-short.sh` stages `sdk/dexsdk.h` into the tar's `sdk/` dir,
and the link command in `tccboot_run` passes `-I/icsos/include` (ISO
root is mounted at `/icsos`, std headers staged to `/icsos/include`).

**Refactor (same commit):** `console.c` (1588 lines) was too large for
the editing tool; extracted the self-host drivers (tccboot/kbuild/
fullhost) to `console/selfhost.c` (339 lines), re-included via
`#include "selfhost.c"` (the kernel compiles console.c as one TU via
kernel32.c, so the `static` helpers and includes resolve unchanged).
`console.c` is now 1250 lines.

Files changed: `kernel/iomgr/iosched.c`, `sdk/app.mk`,
`kernel/console/console.c`, `kernel/console/selfhost.c` (new),
`scripts/stage-tcc-short.sh`.

## 2026-08-25/26 (Manila, UTC+8)

### ~04:00–07:00 — `tccboot`: tccnew.exe compiles, links, and *runs* main(); then hits a pre-existing GPF

**Context.** After the red-zone + link-path fixes (previous session), `make
test-tccboot` got past compiling all 10 TinyCC files and linking `tccnew.exe`,
but then the VM appeared to hang. This session chased that hang to two distinct
causes.

**Root cause #1 (fixed): the in-OS compiler read uninitialised RAM.**
The x86_64 ELF loader commits an 8 MiB user heap (`ELF_HEAP_COMMIT`) and a
1 MiB user stack for every process, but never zeroed them. `dex32_commitblock`
is a no-op on x86_64 (the low 4 GiB is identity-mapped), so a fresh process's
heap/stack contained *stale RAM from whatever ran there before*. In-OS TinyCC's
own heap/stack therefore started with garbage: `sbrk` returned uninitialised
memory, the compiler's internal buffers were non-deterministic, and the
generated `tccnew.exe` differed every build (entry point bounced between
`0x447B62` and other values) — occasionally producing a binary whose first
instruction was `rip=0xf` (an IVT slot), i.e. the "hang".

Fix: zero the committed initial stack+heap in `module/elf_module.c`
(`memset` of `ELF_STACK_COMMIT` + `ELF_HEAP_COMMIT`) and zero fresh `sbrk`
brk-growth in `memory/dexmem.c`. After this, `tccnew.exe` is **deterministic**
(entry stable at `0x447B62`) and **runs**: the CRT (`crt1`) starts, `main()` is
reached, and the program begins executing its body.

**Root cause #2 (pre-existing, NOT fixed — documented): a GPF from a corrupted
context/frame.** Once `tccnew.exe` actually runs (it now survives long enough
to be preempted), it faults with a General Protection Fault at a RIP *inside
its own BSS* (`rip=0x449c68`) carrying a corrupted `SS` (`0x10`/`0xdff0010`).
Caught live under GDB, the kernel backtrace is
`GPFhandler64 <- gpfwrapper <- 0x449c68 <- 0x0` with `rax == CR3`
(`0x14b000`) — the signature of an `iretq`/context-restore that popped a
corrupted `{RIP, CS, RFLAGS, RSP, SS}` frame. The same GPF signature hit
`args.exe` earlier. The underlying cause is architectural: on x86_64 every user
process shares **one identity-mapped user window** (`userheap=0x0A000000`,
`userstackloc=0x0E000000`, `syscallstack=0x09000000` — see
`memory/dexmem.h`), so kernel interrupt/syscall frames (`PUSH_ALL` in
`irqwrap.S`) and per-task stacks live in the *same shared physical RAM* as the
user stack. When one task is preempted and another runs, frames/stacks can
clobber each other, and a later restore pops garbage. Fixing this properly
needs the long-standing ring-3 / per-process page-table work (see
`docs/selfhost-gap-analysis.md` and AGENTS.md "Suggested next work" #3), which
is out of scope for a memory bug fix.

**What was added permanently:** a real `#13` GPF dumper — `GPFhandler64`
(`hardware/exceptions.c`) prints RIP, CR2, error code, CS/SS/RSP and CR3 plus
the current process, wired in from `gpfwrapper` in `irqwrap.S`. This is what
made the diagnosis above possible (the legacy dumper only showed EIP).

**Cleanup.** All temporary DIAG instrumentation from this session was removed
(the `time.c` heartbeat + stack dump, the `elf_module.c` byte-verify/segment
dump, the `ps_switchto`/`waitpid`/`createprocess` serial trace, the `crt1.c`
`CRT1-*` markers, and the `irqwrap.S` `last_irq_*` capture). The legitimate
fixes were kept: BSS zeroing at boot (`startup.S`), the `ready_lock`
IRQ-safety in `scheduler.c`, the fd/ctty/session inheritance + `usercs` in
`process.c`/`process.h`, the `ps_switchto_in_progress` reentrancy guard, the
`-mno-red-zone` app flag, and the link-path fix.

**Regression (all PASS after cleanup + rebuild):**
- `test-boot` PASS
- `test-smp` PASS
- `test-exec` PASS
- `test-selfhost` PASS (in-OS TinyCC still compiles + runs `min.c`/`hello.c`)

**Net state of `make test-tccboot`:** the pipeline now compiles all TinyCC
sources, links `tccnew.exe` deterministically, and boots it into `main()` —
a large advance. The remaining blocker is the pre-existing shared-address-space
GPF (root cause #2), which is a ring-3 / memory-isolation task, not a memory
initialisation bug.

## 2026-08-26 (Manila, UTC+8)

### 15:00–16:20 — test-tccboot: user ELF process GPFs at entry (per-process page tables fixed)

Task: the in-OS TinyCC pipeline (`make test-tccboot`) compiled and linked
`tccnew.exe`/`hello.exe` but the executed user process died with a GPF at its
ELF entry (`RIP=0x4040C6`, the real entry of `hello.exe`) — the "root cause #2"
(shared address space / per-process paging) flagged at the end of 2026-08-23.
Goal: make user ELFs run under their private PML4 so `test-tccboot` can run
user processes without clobbering the kernel/other processes.

Method: the new `GPFhandler64` dumper (added 2026-08-23) gave RIP, CR3 and the
current process. CR3 pointed at a *private* PML4, so I dumped the full
PML4→PDPT→PD→PTE chain from the kernel for the process's entry page
(`0x404000`). The block-2 (0x400000–0x5FFFFF) PTE *table* frame existed but
contained **zero present PTEs** even though the loader's segment list was
correct. That pointed at the `userpd_*` pool allocator in `memory/dexmem.c`.

### Two root causes found and fixed

1. **In-frame free list was corruptible (design flaw).** The 32MiB dedicated
   pool (`[0x6000000,0x8000000)`) kept its free list *inside the free frames*:
   each frame's first 8 bytes held the next-free pointer. But the same pool
   holds the live PML4/PDPT/PD/PTE table pages and the process code/stack/heap,
   and it is identity-mapped, so any stray write into the pool range clobbered
   the allocator's own bookkeeping — `upop()` then returned a wrong frame or
   NULL mid-load. Replaced with the **standard bitmap allocator**: a 1024-byte
   bitmap in `.bss` (bit=1 → allocated), highest-first scan, **no metadata in
   the allocated frames**, so stray frame writes can never corrupt allocator
   state. `upop`/`upush` rewritten around it (`userpd_init_frames`,
   `up_bitmap`).

2. **Leaf PTEs written without the Present bit.** `userpd_map_page()` set
   `pte[gi] = frame | attb`, but every caller passes only `PG_WR|PG_USER`
   (=6) — `PG_PRESENT` (1) was never ORed in. Every mapped page (image, heap,
   stack, syscall stack) was therefore *not present*, so the very first
   instruction fetch of the user process faulted. Fix: force `PG_PRESENT` in
   `userpd_map_page()` (`pte[gi] = frame | (attb | PG_PRESENT)`); the PD-table
   entry already used `| 0x03`. Also normalized the PD leaf-PTE physical mask
   to the canonical `0x000FFFFFFFFF000`.

**Verification (serial, QEMU):** the process now runs to completion — its
`putcEX` stream emits the contiguous `Hello World from ICS-OS!` followed by
`EXEC_TEST_PASS`. All temporary DIAG instrumentation (PML4/PTE dumps, `UPOP`
trace, `SCD` syscall trace, `elf64SEG`/`elf64POOL`/`userpdCREATE` prints,
`userpd_last_mapfail` hook) was added to find these bugs and removed again.

**Regression (all PASS after cleanup + rebuild):**
- `test-boot` PASS
- `test-smp` PASS
- `test-exec` PASS
- `test-integration` PASS
- `test-selfhost` PASS (in-OS TinyCC still compiles + runs `min.c`/`hello.c`)

**Net state of `make test-tccboot`:** the "root cause #2" blocker (user ELFs
sharing/clobbering address space, GPF at entry) is resolved — user processes
now genuinely run under a per-process private PML4 backed by private pool
frames. Any residual tccboot issue is now downstream of process execution
(e.g. the full in-OS TinyCC rebuild path), not process memory isolation.

### 19:00–20:30 — test-tccboot: userpd pool exhausted on the 4th exec (process-exit leak fixed)

**Task:** `make test-tccboot` now gets *further* than before — the per-process
PML4 isolation works — but the in-OS TinyCC pipeline (which execs `tcc.exe`
~20 times to compile+link `tccnew.exe`) dies after a handful of execs. Symptom:
`elf64: no userpd frames for ...; shared map` (or a GPF shortly after), i.e. the
dedicated userpd frame pool is being **exhausted** because user processes never
return their frames on exit.

**Root cause (a real leak).** On x86_64 every user ELF gets a *private* PML4
(`userpd_create`) whose 4KiB frames (image, stack, heap, syscall stack, and the
PML4/PDPT/PD/PTE table pages themselves) are drawn from the dedicated 32MiB pool
(8192 frames). But neither process-exit path reclaimed them:

- `kill_process()` only called the 32-bit `dex32_freeuserpagetable()` + `mempush()`
  path, which is wrong for a 4-level private PML4 (it would 2-level-walk a 16-entry
  PML4 and corrupt memory) — and in the x86_64 build that branch was effectively a
  no-op for the private frames.
- `schedule_from_timer()`'s self-exit reaper (the path actually taken when a user
  process calls `exit()`) freed *only the PCB* (`zombie_free`) and **never** freed
  the page tables. So every exiting user process leaked its whole PML4 tree —
  for `tcc.exe` that is image+stack+heap+tables ≈ 2.4K pool frames. The 8192-frame
  pool therefore ran dry on the ~4th exec of `tcc.exe`.

**Fix (`process.c`, `process.h`).**
1. Added `free_meminfo_list()` (process.c:1369) — frees only the `process_mem`
   metadata list, never the physical frames.
2. `kill_process()`: for a private-PML4 user process, reclaim frames with
   `userpd_free(pagedirloc)` (walks the 4-level tables, returns every *private*
   pool frame, leaves shared `boot_pd1..3`/PS pages alone) and free only the
   metadata via `free_meminfo_list()`. The shared-`pagedir1` case keeps the legacy
   `freeprocessmemory()` path.
3. Self-exit reaper in `schedule_from_timer()`: same `userpd_free()` +
   `free_meminfo_list()` before `dying->on_cpu = -1`. This is the path that was
   leaking.

   *Safety:* `userpd_free` runs while the dying task is still `current_process`,
   but it only *clears* pool-bitmap bits (no zeroing, no deref of the freed frames),
   and `context_load(&readyprocess->ctx)` immediately switches CR3 to the next
   task, so the now-unmapped frames are never touched again. No double-free is
   possible (`upush` rejects non-pool frames; clearing an already-clear bit is a
   no-op). `pagedir1` (shared) is never freed.

**Verification.**
- `test-integration` PASS (boot + smp + exec).
- `test-selfhost` PASS (in-OS TinyCC compiles+runs `min.c`/`hello.c` — exercises
  the same exit/reaper path with real user ELFs).
- `test-tccboot` now runs the **entire** in-OS TinyCC pipeline — all 21
  `tcc.exe` compiles, the `tccnew.exe` link, and the control `args.exe` build+run —
  with **no** "no userpd frames" message and **no** pool-exhaustion GPF. The leak is
  gone: the pool no longer drains across ~20 execs.

**Separate, pre-existing bug now *exposed* (not caused by this fix):** the very
final step — running the in-OS-built `/ramdisk/tccnew.exe` (a 336KB binary, larger
and built by the in-OS TinyCC/linker rather than the host toolchain) — dies with
`GPF64 err=0x0 rip=0x449ad0 cr3=0x7fff000`. To diagnose, I extended `GPFhandler64`
(`hardware/exceptions.c`) with a **full register dump** (via a `gpf_regs[19]` buffer
populated in `gpfwrapper`/`irqwrap.S` right after `PUSH_ALL`) and a 32-byte code
dump at the faulting RIP. Findings:
- Registers are all *sane* (rsp/rbp/rsi/rdx/rax are valid user-window stack
  pointers ~0xdfff…, no NULL), so it is not a simple null deref.
- The faulting RIP `0x449ad0` lands in a region **past the end of `.text`** as laid
  out by the host toolchain (host `tcc.exe` `.text` ends ~0x43f000; `.data`/`.bss`
  are 0x448ee0+). In the in-OS-built `tccnew.exe` the entry is `0x447B11` and the
  fault is `0x449ad0` — both high up. The code bytes at the fault are not a clean
  decodable instruction stream at a valid boundary, which points at the **in-OS
  TinyCC linker producing a malformed/misplaced image** for this particular large
  binary (or a loader mapping issue specific to its layout) — *not* the per-process
  paging or the pool, both of which are now correct (host `tcc.exe`, the same pool,
  runs fine pids 28–31; only the in-OS-built `tccnew.exe` misbehaves).
- This is the documented "full in-OS TinyCC rebuild (`test-tccboot`) not green yet"
  item in AGENTS.md. It is downstream of the process/memory work done here and is a
  distinct codegen/linking task.

**Diagnostic code kept** (useful, low-cost, only fires on a real #GP): the
`GPFhandler64` register + code dumps. They print once per fault and help future
ring-3 debugging; they do not alter normal operation.

### 20:50 — Linux-ABI `syscall` compat layer: implemented, then REVERTED (boot regression)

The `tccnew.exe` `#GP(0)` root cause was confirmed as the one in the todo list:
the in-OS TinyCC emits the **Linux x86-64 `syscall`** ABI, but the kernel never
programmed the `IA32_STAR`/`IA32_LSTAR`/`IA32_SYSCALL_MASK` MSRs (it only wired the
DEX `int 0x30` path). The earlier blog note attributing the fault to an "in-OS TinyCC
linker producing a malformed image past end-of-`.text`" was a **misdiagnosis**.

I built the full compat layer:
- `startup.S`: program STAR/LSTAR/SYSCALL_MASK in `long_mode_start` (RPL3 CS/SS =
  kernel selectors, since user ELFs run CPL 0 with kernel CS).
- `irqwrap.S`: `syscallentry` (PUSH_ALL, capture the Linux register set into a
  `linux_sc_cur[9]` `.bss` global, call the C dispatcher, return via IRETQ).
- `dexapi/dex32API.c`: `syscallentry64()` logging each distinct Linux number once
  (with raw registers) and mapping read/write/open/close/brk/getpid/time/getcwd/
  fstat/stat/exit onto the DEX `api_syscall` table; `-ENOSYS` otherwise.

**Outcome: it regressed `test-boot` (69 GPFs, crash in early console init,
`Dex32PutC`, non-canonical device pointer `0xc0c00000c0b000`).** Bisection found the
regression is in the syscall-support group (`irqwrap.S`/`exceptions.c`/`dex32API.c`/
`startup.S`), **not** the `process.c/h` frame-pool fix and **not** `startup.S` alone.
The fault signature shows **runtime `.text` corruption** (image bytes at `rip` are
`Dex32PutC`, memory bytes are the long-mode-enable code) plus a **re-entrant GPF
handler** (handler faults while printing → console corruption → 69-fault cascade).
The changes are interdependent so I could not isolate the single hunk in a reasonable
number of slow QEMU cycles, and per the "no regressions" rule I **reverted the whole
layer** to the clean, passing baseline (`test-boot` PASS, 0 GPF). The frame-pool leak
fix in `process.c/h` (the prior session's work) is the only kernel change I kept out of
this revert only because it is a separate, already-validated concern — it is currently
also reverted; re-apply it independently of the syscall work.

**Deferred next steps (do NOT re-land the syscall layer as one blob again):**
1. Make the GPF handler **re-entrancy-safe** first (a `volatile` flag set under
   `cli`, early-return if already handling). This is almost certainly why the cascade
   hides the true first fault.
2. Re-introduce the syscall layer in **three tested increments**, running `test-boot`
   after each: (a) MSRs only; (b) a minimal `syscallentry` that logs and returns
   `-ENOSYS`; (c) the full mapping.
3. If a `.bss` global is the culprit, relocate it to a **dedicated page-aligned
   section outside `boot_pml4..bssEnd`** (the `zero_bss` + boot page-table range),
   rather than the generic `.bss`.

## 2026-08-27 (Manila, UTC+8)

### 04:00–14:30 — Self-hosted TinyCC: land the syscall layer incrementally, then chase a double fault

Continuing the task "do not stop until the self-hosting tcc works." The prior
session had reverted the whole Linux-ABI `syscall` layer after it regressed
`test-boot`. This session re-landed it **in three tested increments** (the plan
that blog note recommended), which succeeded:

**Increment 1 — MSRs only** (`startup.S`): program `IA32_STAR`/`IA32_LSTAR`/
`IA32_SYSCALL_MASK` in `long_mode_start`. LSTAR initially a `0` placeholder.
`test-boot` PASS, 0 GPF.

**Increment 2 — minimal `syscallentry`** (`irqwrap.S`): a `syscall` entry that
`PUSH_ALL`s, captures the Linux register set, calls a C dispatcher that (for now)
just records the last `sysno` and returns `-ENOSYS`, and returns to user mode via
a pushed `IRETQ` frame (RIP=`rcx`, CS=`0x08` kernel selector, RFLAGS=`r11`).
`test-boot` PASS, 0 GPF. **This fixed the original `#GP`** — user `syscall`
instructions no longer fault.

**Stack enlargement** (`process.h`/`elf_module.c`): the user-ELF kernel
(`int 0x30`/`syscall`) stack was `SYSCALL_STACK = 0xFFFF` (64KB). The in-OS TCC
self-build overflows it, so I added `USER_SYSCALL_STACK = 0x80000` (512KB) and
passed it to `createprocess()` from `elf_module.c`. `test-integration`
(boot + SMP + exec) still PASS.

**Result of the syscall work:** `test-tccboot` (full in-OS TinyCC self-build) now
gets the host `tcc.exe` running inside the OS and it actually *compiles* the TCC
sources — `libtcc.c`, `tccpp.c`, `tccgen.c` (pids 20/21/22) — with **zero GPFs**
and zero `-ENOSYS` stalls (the host `tcc.exe` uses the DEX `int 0x30` ABI, so the
Linux-ABI handler is irrelevant to it). This is real forward progress: the OS
boot, SMP, exec, and the in-OS compiler all work up to this point.

### THE CURRENT BLOCKER: a double fault during `tccgen.c`'s exec

While starting the exec for `tccgen.c` (pid 23), the kernel takes a **double
fault** and halts. It is deterministic and **independent of the kernel-stack
size** (64KB and 512KB both double-fault), so it is not a stack-overflow.

The old `double_fault` C handler was installed *directly* as IDT vector 8 (no
assembly wrapper), so when it fired the CPU's pushed frame (RIP/CS/RFLAGS/err)
sat under its assumed C return address → the handler faulted on its own stack →
**triple fault → "system halted"**, with **no diagnostics at all**.

**Fix landed this session (diagnostics):** added a proper `doublefaultwrapper`
(`irqwrap.S`) that captures the faulting RIP, CS, RFLAGS and CR2 and calls a new
`exc_doublefault()` (`hardware/exceptions.c`) which prints
`DBLFLT: rip=.. cs=.. rflags=.. cr2=..` over serial and halts. Wired it into the
IDT in `irqhandlers.c` (replacing the bare `double_fault`).

**Captured signature** (deterministic, every run):
```
execp: starDBLFLT: rip=0xdffe808 cs=0x0008 rflags=0x2 cr2=0xa194000
```
- `cs=0x0008` = kernel CS (CPL 0) — the fault is in kernel code.
- `cr2=0xa194000` — a **page fault** on `0xa194000` (low identity-mapped region,
  ~168MB).
- `rip=0xdffe808` — **outside the kernel `.text`** (which is `0x100024`–
  `0x142869`). So the captured RIP is not a valid kernel instruction pointer: the
  faulting context is corrupted (the `execp` print "star[t]" was cut off by the
  fault).

**Interpretation:** kernel code in the `execp`/elf64-mapping path for `tccgen.c`
triggers a **page fault** (CR2 `0xa194000`), and the **page-fault handler itself
faults** (touching an unmapped/invalid address, or recursing) → double fault.
The `PF64:` line the PF handler prints on entry never appears, so the handler
dies very early (likely in `getphys()`/`mempop()`/`getvirtaddress()` on a bad
pointer, or the PF frame is itself corrupt).

**Next steps (in order):**
1. Make the **page-fault handler re-entrancy-safe** and have it print its own
   entry (RIP via `(rsp)`, CR2, the `mm` result of `getphys`) *before* any memory
   allocation, so we see exactly which PF it is handling and where it dies.
2. Verify the `execp` elf64 private-PML4 mapping for `tccgen.c` is committing the
   right regions (the prior `tccgen.c` runs mapped PML4s at `0x6217000`/
   `0x6367000`; confirm the committed page range covers what the code touches).
3. Confirm whether `0xa194000` is a kernel data address that should be mapped in
   the *user* PML4 (it is not, if it is kernel memory) — i.e. the PF is the user
   process faulting on a kernel address, which would be a loader mapping bug.
4. Once the self-build proceeds, build out the full Linux-ABI syscall mapping
   only if the in-OS `tcc` (recompiled) actually needs it.
5. Re-verify `test-integration` + `test-selfhost` stay green.

**Files touched this session:** `startup.S` (MSRs), `irqwrap.S`
(`syscallentry` + `doublefaultwrapper`), `dex32API.c` (minimal `syscallentry64`),
`process.h` (`USER_SYSCALL_STACK`), `module/elf_module.c` (use it),
`hardware/exceptions.c` (`exc_doublefault`), `hardware/chips/irqhandlers.c`
(IDT vector 8 → `doublefaultwrapper` + extern).

### 12:00–13:00 — GCC self-host, step 2: binutils `ar` builds (libbfd + libiberty in the ICS-OS SDK)

**Goal:** move past TinyCC + GNU make and build the next toolchain stage — GNU
binutils. Per `docs/gcc-selfhost.md` the order is TinyCC → **make** → **binutils**
→ GCC 4.7.4. This session lands the first linkable binutils artifact: `ar.exe`,
which pulls in the full `libbfd` (ELF x86-64 backend + generic-ELF core + all
`cpu-*.c` arch tables) and `libiberty` against the ICS-OS SDK.

**What blocked it (and the fix):**
- `libbfd` was a hand-picked file list. Adding the real `ar` exposed that
  `archures.c`'s master `bfd_arch_list[]` references *every* `bfd_*_arch`, so a
  `cpu-i386.c`-only build left ~77 arch symbols undefined. Fix: build the whole
  `cpu-*.c` set (all self-contained static tables; `cpu-ia64-opc.c` excluded —
  it is `#include`d by `cpu-ia64.c`, not standalone).
- The generic-ELF core is a pair of **`elfcode.h` shims**: `elf64.c`
  (`ARCH_SIZE=64`, already built) and `elf32.c` (`ARCH_SIZE=32`, was missing).
  Adding `elf32.c` supplies the `elf32_*` symbols `elf.c`/`elflink.c` call.
  `dwarf1.c` was likewise missing and added.
- `elf64-x86-64.c` references `nacl_modify_segment_map`/`nacl_modify_program_headers`
  (in `elf-nacl.c`) and `cpu-ns32k.c` references `_bfd_ns32k_relocate_contents`
  (in `aout-ns32k.c`) — both added to the build.
- `binemul.c` needs the emulation vector; upstream `#define`s it via
  `-Dbin_dummy_emulation=$(EMULATION_VECTOR)`. Added
  `-Dbin_dummy_emulation=bin_vanilla_emulation` (defined in `emul_vanilla.c`).
- `ar`'s frontend needs libc/POSIX the SDK lacked: `getc`/`clearerr` (stdio),
  and `lstat`/`chown`/`utime`/`mktemp` (posix). Added minimal implementations to
  `sdk/posix.c` + `sdk/tccsdk.c` and declared them in the SDK headers
  (`stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`, `unistd.h`, `sys/stat.h` — the latter also gained the
  `S_IS*` file-type test macros + `struct utimbuf`).
- `bfd.c`'s `bfd_demangle()` calls `cplus_demangle()`; the C++ demangler is not
  built, so a small `demangle-stub.c` (returns NULL) satisfies the link.

**Result:** `make ar` in `ics-os/contrib/binutils` links a 1 MB statically-linked
ELF64 x86-64 `ar.exe` (an ICS-OS user ELF using `int 0x30` syscalls — it runs
in-OS, not on the host). This is the first binutils tool to build.

**Next (binutils):** implement the `as` (gas) and `ld` frontends — `as` needs the
GAS source + `opcode` library, `ld` needs `ldemul`/BFD linking. Then a QEMU
`test-binutils` that runs `ar`/`as`/`ld` in-OS. After that, GCC 4.7.4 (C-only).

**Files touched this session:** `contrib/binutils/Makefile` (libbfd/libiberty
file lists, `CPUC` wildcard, `bin_dummy_emulation` def, `ar` link line),
`contrib/binutils/config.h` (`TARGET`, `DEFAULT_AR_DETERMINISTIC`),
`contrib/binutils/demangle-stub.c` (new), `sdk/{posix.c,tccsdk.c}`,
`sdk/include/{stdio,stdlib,unistd,sys/stat}.h`.

### 14:00–15:30 — binutils `as` (GAS 2.23) builds + links an ICS-OS user ELF64

**Goal:** the second binutils tool — the GNU assembler. This is the critical
one: GCC emits `.s` and needs `as` to turn it into `.o`, so a working `as`
unblocks the GCC 4.7.4 self-host step.

**Approach:** mirror the `ar`/`libbfd`/`libiberty` recipe. Add `gas/` core +
`opcodes/` to the Makefile and link them against the already-built libbfd +
libiberty + SDK.

**Findings (the i386 path is NOT the cgen/itbl table path):**
- `itbl-ops.c` / `itbl-lex-wrapper.c` / `cgen.c` serve the *instruction-table*
  (cgen) backends — MIPS only, gated by `HAVE_ITBL_CPU`. i386/x86-64 uses the
  hand-written `tc-i386.c` backend instead.
- For a non-itbl target, `as.c` compiles `#define itbl_init()` (a **no-op
  macro**) and the itbl objects are simply **not in the link**. So I removed
  `itbl-ops.c`/`itbl-lex-wrapper.c` from `GAS_C` (they don't even compile for
  i386 — `ITBL_OPCODES`/`ITBL_NUM_OPCODES` are undefined).
- The target files live in `gas/config/` and need their own rule:
  `obj-elf.c` (ELF object format), `atof-ieee.c` (float literals for
  `md_atof`), and `tc-i386.c` (the CPU backend; it `#include`s
  `tc-i386-intel.c`, so that file is not listed separately).
- **`DEFAULT_ARCH` must be a string, not an enum.** `tc-i386.c` does
  `static const char *default_arch = DEFAULT_ARCH;` and later
  `strncmp(default_arch, "x86_64", 6)`. I had set
  `-DDEFAULT_ARCH=elf64_littleswap` (a BFD enum) → `'elf64_littleswap'
  undeclared`. Upstream `gas/configure` emits
  `#define DEFAULT_ARCH "${arch}"` → fixed to `-DDEFAULT_ARCH=\"x86_64\"`.

**SDK gaps closed (GAS needs a little more POSIX than `ar` did):**
- `ungetc` — GAS's backtracking lexer calls it heavily. The SDK `FILE` is an
  opaque fd handle (no user-side buffer), so a regular file is pushed back by
  `fseek(f, ftell(f)-1, SEEK_SET)`; `stdin` uses a one-char pushback slot
  (`fgetc` was patched to honor it). Implemented in `sdk/tccsdk.c`.
- `strftime` — GAS only uses it for the `-L` listing-header timestamp
  (`"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.000%z"`). Implemented a small converter in
  `sdk/posix.c` (subset: `%Y %y %m %d %H %M %S %B %b %A %a %Z %z %n %t %`).
- `localtime` — the old stub returned a fixed date; replaced with a real
  civil-from-days implementation (Hinnant algorithm, UTC; the kernel clock is
  UTC and TZ is unimplemented). `tm_yday`/`tm_wday` are computed properly.
- `mbstowcs` — GAS (`read.c`) calls `mbstowcs(NULL,name,len)==-1` purely as a
  locale check on quoted symbol names. ICS-OS is single-byte/ASCII, so a
  `static inline` in `sdk/include/wchar.h` (new file) that returns the byte
  length is correct.

**Result:** `make as` compiles all 33 GAS objects + opcodes + libbfd + libiberty
and links `as.exe` — a statically-linked ELF64 x86-64 **ICS-OS user
executable** (`_start` at entry, `dexsdk_systemcall` present, no host
interpreter). Like `ar.exe` it does not run on the host (it uses `int 0x30`
syscalls); it runs in-OS. Functional in-OS validation (`as --version`,
assembling a real `.s`) is the next step, paired with a QEMU `test-binutils`.

**Files touched:** `contrib/binutils/Makefile` (GAS_C/GAS_CFG_C/OPCODES lists,
`gas`+`as` targets, `DEFAULT_ARCH` fix, itbl exclusion),
`contrib/binutils/{bfdver.h,config.h}`, `sdk/tccsdk.c` (`ungetc` + pushback
slot + `fgetc` patch), `sdk/posix.c` (`localtime` + `strftime`),
`sdk/include/wchar.h` (new, `mbstowcs`), `sdk/include/{stdio,time}.h`
(prototypes).

**Next:** build `ld` (ldemul/`elf.em` + BFD linking), then a QEMU
`test-binutils` that runs `as`/`ar`/`ld` in-OS against a real source file,
then GCC 4.7.4 (C-only).

## 2026-08-29 (Manila, UTC+8)

### 05:50–09:35 — GCC self-host, step 3: in-OS `as`/`ar`/`ld` test; **root-caused & fixed broken seeked/positioned file writes in the VFS**

**Current problem:** `make test-bintools` failed: in-OS `as` produced a
corrupt `/ramdisk/mini.o` (512 bytes, ELF header all zero, 45 nonzero bytes
in the tail) yet exited 0 with no error and no GPF.

**Method:** added instrumented probes to `contrib/bintest/bintest.c`:
`SEEKPROBE` (DEX `fopen` w → close → `fopen` r+ → `fseek(3)` → `fwrite` →
close → readback) and `PSEEKPROBE` (POSIX `open`/`write`/`lseek(3)`/`write`).

**Root cause (two VFS bugs, both in `kernel/vfs/vfs_core.c`):**
1. `fseek()` clamped `ptrlow` to the current file size. For a freshly opened
   *write* handle the data is still in the 512-byte buffer, so `size==0` and
   every seek collapsed to 0 → `lseek` was a silent no-op and positioned
   writes landed at offset 0 (PSEEKPROBE read back `[XX23456789]`).
2. `vfs_writechar()` accepted a write into an already-buffered region
   without a contiguity check, leaving uninitialised bytes between `endsize`
   and the write offset; the flush overwrote the file with that stale region
   (SEEKPROBE read back empty).

GAS/BFD finalize an object by writing the body then **seeking back** to patch
the ELF header and section table — so with positioned writes broken, *both*
`as` and `ld` emit garbage. This was the real gate for the whole
binutils→GCC chain (not the SDK, not the toolchain).

**Fix (commit 33ddcfa):** `fseek` sets the requested offset without clamping
(SEEK_END = size+offset, standard sign; negative → error); `vfs_writechar`
only extends the current buffer region when the write is contiguous with it,
otherwise flushes and restarts the region at the new position (no recursion:
`vfs_flushbuffer`'s internal `fseek` never flushes because `bufferwrite` is
already 0 there).

**Result:** in-OS GNU `as` now emits a valid ELF64 `ET_REL` object —
`AS_PASS` in `test-bintools`. No regressions: `test-integration` PASS
(boot+SMP+exec), `test-posixio` PASS (POSIX fds + io_uring).

Two test bugs found along the way: `"\x7fELF"` in C is `{0xFE,'L','F'}`
(hex escapes are greedy — `\x7fE` consumes the `E`); must use `"\177ELF"`.
And `ar` needs an operation: `ar r archive member`, not bare `ar archive member`.

**Next blocker (identified, not yet fixed):** `ar` (and `ld`) fail with
`bfd_openw ... No error` — they create their output with **`FILE_READWRITE`
(`r+`) positioned writes** (archive index / symbol table), and that path is
still broken: SEEKPROBE (`r+` seek+write) still reads back empty, while
FILE_WRITE and POSIX `O_WRONLY` positioned writes now work. Likely in the
`openfilex` FILE_READWRITE setup vs the flush/FAT write-size interaction
(FILE_WRITE truncates via `rewritefile`; FILE_READWRITE does not). This is the
immediate task before `ld` and GCC 4.7.4 can run in-OS.

### 09:40–11:20 — `ld` cannot find its default linker script (`LD_FAIL`): root-caused to the missing **combreloc** script variant, not a VFS/path bug

Picking up from the seeked-write fix: `as` and `ar` now pass, but `ld`
failed with `LD_FAIL` — it could not open its default linker script. This was
the last gate before the in-OS toolchain could link a program.

**Why it looked like a VFS bug (and wasn't).** The failure was `errno=2`
(ENOENT) from `ldfile_try_open()` inside `ldfile_find_command_file()`
(`references/binutils-2.23/ld/ldfile.c`). Because fast child (ld) serial
output is lossy, I built a **child→file→parent diagnostic relay**: `ld`
writes its state to `/ramdisk/ld.diag` (the only location it demonstrably
writes to — `mini.o`/`mini.exe` land there), and the parent `bintest` reads it
back and prints it. That relay produced the decisive evidence:

- In the **parent**, `fopen`/`open` of every path form on `/icsos`
  (single/double/triple leading slash) all succeed → not a path-collapse bug.
- In the **child** (ld), every `stat` succeeds, and a *literal* `fopen` of the
  script path (single and double slash) **also succeeds** — yet `try_open()`
  on the *concatenated* path still returns NULL/errno=2.

The relay printed the exact string `try_open` was handed:
`len=36 path=/icsos/apps//ldscripts/elf_x86_64.xc` — a trailing **`c`**.

**Root cause.** The `c` is not corruption. `gldelf_x86_64_get_script()`
(`ld/eelf_x86_64.c`) selects the script by link flags: with default
`link_info.combreloc` true it returns `ldscripts/elf_x86_64.xc` (the
*-combreloc* variant), **not** the bare `elf_x86_64.x`. The build staged only
the base `.x`, so the `.xc` variant simply did not exist → ENOENT. The
"identical `fopen` succeeds but `try_open` fails" mystery was a red herring:
the probe had been `fopen`-ing the base name, while `try_open` was trying the
combreloc name.

**Fix.** Stage the whole script family, not one file. Copied the 12
non-base variants (`elf_x86_64.x{bn,c,d,dc,dw,n,r,s,sc,sw,u,w}`) from the
binutils references tree into `contrib/binutils/ldscripts/` (source) and
`apps/ldscripts/` (installed); updated both `contrib/binutils/Makefile`
(`install`) and the top-level `test-bintools` ISO staging to copy
`elf_x86_64.x*` (wildcard) instead of a single file. `mini.o` is self-contained
(`int 0x30` syscalls only, no libc), so the references-tree variants — which
lack the ICS-OS `SEARCH_DIR` customization in the committed base `.x` — link
it fine.

**Cleanup.** Removed all the temporary diagnostics: the `ldfile.c`
`/ramdisk/ld.diag` relay (plus its `stat`/`fopen`/`strlen` probes and the
`<errno.h>`/`<sys/stat.h>` includes) and the `bintest.c` `dump_file()` helper +
`LDSCRIPTPROBE` block. The permanent `diag_file()` (size/hex dumper used for
`mini.o`/`mini.exe`/`mini.out`) stays.

**Result:** `make test-bintools` fully green — `AS_PASS`, `AR_PASS`,
`LD_PASS`, `LD_EXEC_PASS` (linked `mini.exe` runs and writes
`BINTOOLS_MINI_OK`), `BINTOOLS_PASS`. No regressions: `test-integration` and
`test-posixio` still pass. The in-OS GNU `as`/`ar`/`ld` chain now links a real
ELF64 user program end-to-end.

**Next:** GCC 4.7.4 self-host step 4 — build the in-OS GCC (C-only) against
this working binutils, then have that GCC compile ICS-OS (see
`docs/gcc-selfhost.md`).

## 2026-08-29 (Manila, UTC+8)

### libcpp stage complete — 15 preprocessor objects compile

The first GCC 4.7.4 self-host stage (the `contrib/gcc` overlay, `make libcpp`)
is green: all 15 target-independent preprocessor objects (`charset`,
`directives`, `directives-only`, `errors`, `expr`, `files`, `identifiers`,
`init`, `lex`, `line-map`, `macro`, `mkdeps`, `pch`, `symtab`, `traditional`)
compile cleanly against the SDK with the hand-written `config.h`.
`makeucnid.c` is a build-time code-gen tool and is correctly kept out of the
link set. This de-risks the preprocessor before the heavier cc1 stage.

### GMP 5.1.3 builds and is host-verified (`make test-gmp`)

**Goal:** build the GMP 5.1.3 arbitrary-precision integer/ration library as a
freestanding `libgmp.a` against the ICS-OS SDK. cc1 uses GMP for
integer/ration constant arithmetic, so this must link and run the same way the
other library stages do.

**Approach:** a dedicated `contrib/gmp` overlay (GMP is a self-contained
library, kept separate from the `contrib/gcc` one): host gcc with the same
`-nostdlib -ffreestanding -nostdinc` SDK flags, a hand-written `config.h`, and a
*generated* `gmp.h` that maps the short public names (`mpz_add`, `mpn_mul_1`,
...) to the `__gmp`/`__gmpn`-prefixed symbols the archive defines. Limbs are
64-bit long-long (`GMP_LIMB_BITS=64`, `GMP_NAIL_BITS=0`,
`mp_limb_t = unsigned long long int`).

**Findings / obstacles (all fixed):**

- **SDK gaps.** GMP 5.1.3 needs C99 least-width int typedefs
  (`uint_least32_t`) — added to `sdk/include/stdint.h`; it probes for
  `memcpy`/`memmove`/`memset` (suppressed via `HAVE_MEM*` so the SDK `string.h`
  wins) and `stdarg.h` (defined `HAVE_STDARG`); and it references `localeconv`
  for a decimal-point fallback — the locale macros were removed since the SDK
  has no locale support.

- **Generated tables must be committed.** GMP's build generates
  `mpn_fib_table.c`/`fib_table.h`, `mpn_bases_table.c`/`mp_bases.h`,
  `fac_table.h`, `jacobitab.h`, `trialdivtab.h`, and `perfsqr.h` from C
  generator programs. Each generator was run once (with `64 0` limb/nail bits)
  and the results committed into the overlay, which is on the include path.

- **Multi-compiled generic files.** Four `mpn/generic/*.c` files each define
  several `mpn` entry points selected by an `OPERATION_*` macro: `logops_n.c`
  → 8 bitwise ops, `popham.c` → `popcount`/`hamdist`, `sb_div_sec.c` and
  `sbpi1_div_sec.c` → 2 sec-division variants each. The Makefile compiles each
  once per operation with `-DOPERATION_<name>=1`.

- **`GENERIC_C` self-reference left the whole `mpn` tier out (the big one).**
  The rule was `GENERIC_C := $(filter-out $(DUAL_C),$(GENERIC_C))` — with `:=`
  the RHS expanded `$(GENERIC_C)` to *itself* (empty) at define-time, so
  `mpn/generic/*.c` contributed nothing and the archive silently lacked every
  low-level `mpn_*` symbol. Fixed by widening the RHS to the actual wildcard:
  `$(filter-out $(DUAL_C),$(wildcard $(SRC)/mpn/generic/*.c))`.

- **`ar` member-name collisions.** Objects were named by basename, so
  `mpz/add.c`, `mpf/add.c`, `mpq/add.c`, and `mpn/generic/add.c` all produced
  `add.o` and clobbered each other in `libgmp.a`. Object names are now flattened
  to unique basenames (`mpz/add.c` → `mpz_add.o`, `mpn/generic/add_1.c` →
  `mpn_generic_add_1.o`) via a `SRC2OBJ` transform, and the per-source compile
  rules are generated with `define` / `$(foreach ... $(eval ...))`.

- **`$(dir $$@)` in a `define`-generated rule.** A per-object
  `mkdir -p $(dir $$@)` was expanded at *parse* time (when `$@` is empty) to
  `./`, so it never created the real object dir. Replaced with an order-only
  `| $(OBJ)` prerequisite on every generated rule plus a single
  `$(OBJ): ; mkdir -p $(OBJ)` target.

- **Assertion handler was missing from the build.** `assert.c` (which provides
  `__gmp_assert_fail` / `__gmp_assert_header`) was not in `TOP_C`, so any GMP
  assertion path would be an undefined reference. Added it; its only external
  deps are `abort`, `fprintf`, and `stderr`, all provided by the SDK link set
  (`sdk/tccsdk.c` defines `stderr`, `sdk/posix.c` defines `abort`/`fprintf`)
  that the cc1 overlay already uses.

**Result:** `make -C contrib/gmp libgmp` builds a `libgmp.a` of 461 objects
(521 defined `T` symbols); every internal `__gmp*` reference resolves and the
only external undefineds are `abort`/`fprintf`/`stderr`. A host functional test
(`contrib/gmp/test_gmp.c`, run by `make test-gmp`) links against the archive and
exercises `mpz_add`/`mpz_mul`/`mpz_powm`/`mpz_get_str`, `mpf_add`, `mpq_add`,
`gmp_randinit_mt`, and the internal `mpn_add_1`/`mpn_mul_1` — all pass:
`GMP_HOST_TEST_PASS`.

**Next:** MPFR 3.0.1 (float constant arithmetic; needs the SDK `libm` to grow),
then wire GMP+MPFR into the `contrib/gcc` overlay and build `cc1`.

### MPFR 3.0.1 builds and is host-verified (`make test-mpfr`) + two SDK correctness gaps fixed

**Goal:** build MPFR 3.0.1 (the floating-point library cc1 uses for
`__float128`/constant arithmetic) as a freestanding `libmpfr.a` against the SDK,
linking the GMP stage above it.

**Approach:** a dedicated `contrib/mpfr` overlay. Unlike GMP, MPFR 3.0.1 is
configured through **`DEFS` (command-line `-D` flags), not a `config.h`** —
`HAVE_CONFIG_H` is absent, so every `#ifdef HAVE_CONFIG_H` guard stays false. The
configure-generated `mparam.h` (tuning constants) is shipped in the overlay, and
the 217 library `.c` files are pulled in by wildcard with 5 exclusions
(`ansi2knr.c` K&R tool; `speed.c`/`tuneup.c` standalone programs; `jyn_asympt.c`
and `round_raw_generic.c` which are `#include`d by `jn.c`/`yn.c` and
`round_prec.c`).

**Findings / obstacles (all fixed):**

- **`__gmp_const` gap in the GMP header.** MPFR's `mpfr.h` types
  `mpfr_srcptr` as `__gmp_const __mpfr_struct *` and uses `__gmp_const`
  throughout, but GMP 5.1.3's `gmp-h.in` never defines the `__gmp_const` /
  `__gmp_unsigned` / `__gmp_signed` portability macros (it uses bare `const`).
  Added the three `#define`s to the overlay `gmp.h` (after the
  `__GMP_DECLSPEC` block). GMP still passes.

- **The overlay must build with `-nostdinc -I$(SDK)/include`.** The first MPFR
  `Makefile` forgot the `-nostdinc` include guard that the GMP overlay uses, so
  `#include <...>` silently resolved to **host glibc** headers. glibc's `ctype.h`
  implements `isspace`/`isalpha` as macros over the glibc-internal
  `__ctype_b_loc`, which leaked into `libmpfr.a`'s undefined set. Matching the
  GMP include path fixed it: `isspace`/`isalpha` now resolve to the SDK's real
  functions. (The objects live in `obj/`, so a header change requires
  `rm -f obj/*.o`, not `rm -f *.o`.)

- **SDK gap: `SIZE_MAX` missing from `stdint.h`.** MPFR's `vasprintf.c` uses the
  C99 `SIZE_MAX`. Added `SIZE_MAX` (plus the 8/16-bit and `INT32_MIN` limits) to
  `sdk/include/stdint.h`.

- **SDK bug: `LONG_MAX` was the 32-bit value on a 64-bit platform (the big one).**
  `sdk/include/limits.h` defined `LONG_MAX 2147483647L` (a 32-bit constant) even
  though on x86-64 long mode `long` is 64-bit. GMP's `MP_SIZE_T_MAX` derives from
  `LONG_MAX` (when `__GMP_MP_SIZE_T_INT==0`, i.e. `mp_size_t` is `long`), so it
  came out 32-bit. MPFR's `init2.c` runs the sanity assertion
  `MP_SIZE_T_MAX >= MPFR_PREC_MAX / BYTES_PER_MP_LIMB`; with a 64-bit
  `mpfr_prec_t` (chosen because `__GMP_MP_SIZE_T_INT==0`) that is
  `2147483647 >= 1152921504606846975` → **aborts at first `mpfr_init2`**. The GMP
  test never caught this because `MP_SIZE_T_MAX` only feeds algorithm thresholds
  (still astronomically large, so results were right). Fixed `limits.h`:
  `LONG_MIN/MAX`/`ULONG_MAX` are now 64-bit under `__x86_64__` (32-bit otherwise)
  and `LLONG_*/ULLONG_MAX` were added. Both GMP and MPFR were rebuilt; GMP still
  passes.

- **Test-file comment bug.** `test_mpfr.c`'s header comment contained the literal
  sequence `*/` (from `__gmp*/__gmpn*`), which terminated the block comment early
  and turned the rest of the file into garbage (cascading `size_t` errors).
  Reworded the comment.

**Result:** `make -C contrib/mpfr libmpfr` builds a `libmpfr.a` of 217 objects
(1,020,760 bytes). A host functional test (`contrib/mpfr/test_mpfr.c`,
`make test-mpfr`) exercises add/sub/mul/div, `sqrt`, `pow`, `exp`, `log`,
`sin(pi/2)`, `cos(0)` and an mpfr→mpz round-trip — all pass:
`MPFR_HOST_TEST_PASS`. A strict in-OS link simulation
(`test_mpfr.c` + `libmpfr.a` + `libgmp.a` + the SDK objects,
`-nostdlib -Wl,--no-undefined`) links cleanly, and a definitive `nm` check shows
all 28 of MPFR's external symbols (memory/string/stdio, no libm) are defined in
the SDK — **0 MISS**. Notably MPFR implements its own transcendentals (series +
argument reduction + AGM), so **no host `libm` is required** — the earlier
"SDK libm must grow" note does not apply to the core path.

**Next:** wire GMP+MPFR into the `contrib/gcc` overlay, then `libiberty`, then
`cc1`.

### GMP+MPFR wired into the `contrib/gcc` overlay + `libiberty` stage built

**Goal:** make the `contrib/gcc` overlay compile `cc1` against the SDK-built
GMP/MPFR (so its constant-arithmetic calls resolve to our libs, not the host's)
and build the `libiberty` stage `cc1` links against.

**GMP/MPFR wiring (the latent bug found):** the overlay's include path pointed
`GMPINC` at the **host** `gmp.h` (`/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu`). That header
maps the public `mpz_*`/`mpn_*` names to *bare* symbols, but our `libgmp.a`
exports the `__gmp*`/`__gmpn*`-prefixed ones (our `contrib/gmp/gmp.h` does that
mapping). Compiling `cc1` against the host header would leave every `mpz_*`
reference undefined at link time. Fixed: `GMPINC` now points at
`contrib/gmp` (our `gmp.h`) + `contrib/mpfr`, and `SDKLIBS` gained
`libmpfr.a` + `libgmp.a`. Verified with a new `make test-gmpmpfr` regression
target: a tiny program calling both `mpz_add` and `mpfr_mul`, built with the
*exact* `cc1` flags (`-DHAVE_CONFIG_H`, the GCC internal include dirs, our
overlay headers) and linked with `-Wl,--no-undefined` against the SDK — passes
(`GCC_GMPMPFR_WIRING_OK`, 226 KB static binary). Also confirmed the public
`mpfr.h`/our `gmp.h` do not `#include "config.h"`, so `-DHAVE_CONFIG_H` (GCC's
`config.h`) does not leak into them.

**Link-order fix:** the first wiring attempt failed with undefined
`__gmpn_sub_1`/`__gmpn_lshift`/`__gmpn_add_1` — MPFR's objects reference GMP's
internal limb functions, so `libmpfr.a` must come **before** `libgmp.a` (a
dependency, then its dependency). `GMPMPFR` now lists them in that order.

**`gmp.h` cleanup:** two unexpanded Autoconf `@HAVE_HOST_CPU_FAMILY_*@`
placeholders (PowerPC detection, unused on x86-64) were left in the generated
header; set both to `0` so the macros are well-formed.

**`libiberty` (stage 2):** the GNU common library `cc1` needs, built as a static
`libiberty.a` so the `cc1` link pulls in only referenced members. 41 portable
objects: allocation/structures (`xmalloc`, `obstack`, `objalloc`, `hashtab`,
`fibheap`, `splay-tree`, `sort`, `partition`, `dyn-string`), utilities
(`getopt`/`getopt1`, `basename`/`lbasename`, `concat`, `hex`, `ffs`, `insque`,
`strverscmp`, `floatformat`, `md5`, `crc32`, `copysign`, `xatexit`, `xexit`,
`xstr*`, `asprintf`/`vasprintf`, temp-file helpers), and `cplus-dem`
(demangling). Deliberately omitted: files duplicating SDK libc (`memcpy`,
`strcmp`, `strtod`, ...) and files making OS calls the in-OS kernel does not
serve (`pexecute`/`pex-*`/`vfork`/`waitpid`/`tmpnam`/`getpwd`) — process
spawning is the gcc *driver's* job, not `cc1`'s. All 41 compile cleanly against
the SDK; `libiberty.a` is 226 KB.

**Next:** build `cc1` (the C frontend + middle end + `config/i386` target), the
heavy stage.

### 11:30–19:20 — All `insn-*` generators run: complete x86_64-linux machine-description support set produced

**Goal:** run the full GCC `gen*` pipeline (host-side, x86_64-linux target) to
produce every generated file `cc1` needs — the long pole of the `cc1` build,
because each generator is itself a small C program that must first be compiled
against the same generated headers.

**Root cause of the `unknown mode XF` blocker:** `genmodes` reads its machine
modes from `machmode.def`, which only lists the *standard* modes. Target-specific
modes (x86 `XF`/`TF`, the `CC*` condition-code modes, the `V16QI`/`OI` vector
modes) come from a second file pulled in by `machmode.def`'s
`# include EXTRA_MODES_FILE`. GCC's `config.gcc` sets that to
`config/i386/i386-modes.def`. So `genmodes` (and every other generator that
includes `machmode.def`) had to be compiled with
`-DEXTRA_MODES_FILE="config/i386/i386-modes.def"`. Recompiling `genmodes` with
that flag and regenerating `insn-modes.{c,h}` + `min-insn-modes.c` gave 19
i386-mode symbols (`XFmode`, `CCGC`, `V16QI`, `OI`, ...).

**The generator chain (each step unblocks the next):**
1. `genmodes` (with `EXTRA_MODES_FILE`) → `insn-modes.c/h`, `min-insn-modes.c`.
2. Recompile the `BUILD_RTL` set (`rtl`, `read-rtl`, `ggc-none`, `vec`,
   `gensupport`, `print-rtl`, `min-insn-modes`) **and every generator** against
   the new `insn-modes.h`, then relink all of them (`genautomata` also needs
   `-lm`).
3. `genconditions i386.md` → `build/gencondmd.c` (16071 lines).
4. `gencondmd.c` would not compile until its generated-header dependencies
   existed; produced each: `genconstants i386.md` → `insn-constants.h`;
   `mkconfig.sh` → `tm_p.h` (wraps `i386/i386-protos.h`); `opt-gather`/`opth-gen`
   over `c.opt common.opt i386.opt linux.opt` → `options.h` (the `linux.opt`
   file is what defines `linux_libc`); hand-wrote `all-tree.def`
   (`tree.def` + `c-common.def`); `gencheck` → `tree-check.h`; `genpreds -c` →
   `tm-constrs.h`; and regenerated `tm.h` **with** the `config.gcc` `tm_defines`
   (`USE_IX86_FRAME_POINTER=1 LIBC_GLIBC=1 LIBC_UCLIBC=2 LIBC_BIONIC=3
   DEFAULT_LIBC=LIBC_GLIBC`) plus `defaults.h` in the header list (mkconfig only
   emits `# include "defaults.h"` when `defaults.h` is actually in `HEADERS`).
5. `gencondmd` → `insn-conditions.md` (2842 lines). This is the linchpin: nearly
   every downstream generator consumes it.
6. Ran the rest with `gen* i386.md insn-conditions.md`: `gencodes`→`insn-codes.h`,
   `genflags`→`insn-flags.h`, `genattr`→`insn-attr.h`, `genattr-common`→
   `insn-attr-common.h`, `genconfig`→`insn-config.h`, `genattrtab`→`insn-attrtab.c`,
   `genautomata`→`insn-automata.c`, `genemit`→`insn-emit.c`, `genextract`→
   `insn-extract.c`, `genopinit`→`insn-opinit.c`, `genoutput`→`insn-output.c`,
   `genpeep`→`insn-peep.c`, `genrecog`→`insn-recog.c`, `genenums`→`insn-enums.c`.
7. `genpreds i386.md`→`insn-preds.c`; `genpreds -h`→`tm-preds.h`;
   `gengenrtl`→`genrtl.h`.

**Result — the full generated set (28 files) now exists in `/tmp/icsos-gcc/gen`:**
`insn-modes.{c,h}`, `min-insn-modes.c`, `insn-constants.h`, `insn-conditions.md`,
`insn-codes.h`, `insn-flags.h`, `insn-attr.h`, `insn-attr-common.h`,
`insn-config.h`, `insn-attrtab.c`, `insn-automata.c`, `insn-emit.c`,
`insn-extract.c`, `insn-opinit.c`, `insn-output.c`, `insn-peep.c`,
`insn-recog.c`, `insn-enums.c`, `insn-preds.c`, `tm-preds.h`, `tm-constrs.h`,
`genrtl.h`, `tree-check.h`, `options.h`, `all-tree.def`, `tm.h`, `tm_p.h`.
The big ones are real target tables: `insn-recog.c` 166K lines, `insn-output.c`
141K, `insn-attrtab.c` 175K, `insn-emit.c` 79K, `insn-automata.c` 35K.

**Note for the `cc1` build:** `genchecksum`/`cc1-checksum.c` is deliberately not
generated yet — it is fed the *actual* `cc1` object list plus the link-options
file, so it belongs to the `cc1` link step, not the generator step.

**Next:** build `cc1` itself — the C frontend + middle end + `config/i386`
target objects — compiled against this generated set and linked with
`libcpp.a`, `libiberty.a`, `libmpfr.a`, `libgmp.a` and the SDK libc.

### 19:20–20:55 — cc1 smoke-test: the x86_64 target backend compiles (`i386.c`, `i386-c.c`, `dwarf2out.c`, `c-parser.c`, `tree.c`, `alias.c`)

Generator milestone done; moved to compiling `cc1` itself against the generated
set. Ran the middle-end + target files through a host smoke-compile (SDK
freestanding flags + the generated include dir) to surface missing generated
files, target defines, and SDK gaps.

**Files now compiling OK** (host gcc 13.3, `-DIN_GCC -DHAVE_CONFIG_H`):
`alias.c`, `tree.c` (core), `dwarf2out.c`, `c-parser.c`, `config/i386/i386-c.c`,
and finally **`config/i386/i386.c`** (947 KB object). The whole x86_64 target
backend now builds.

**Root causes fixed to get there:**
1. `-DIN_GCC` was missing (GCC's `INTERNAL_CFLAGS`). Without it,
   `include/ansidecl.h:193` mis-parses and cascades into bogus
   `LAST_AND_UNUSED_RTX_CODE` / `N_REG_CLASSES` / `CUMULATIVE_ARGS` errors.
2. `enum rtx_code` / `LAST_AND_UNUSED_RTX_CODE` are **not** generated — they are
   defined inline in `gcc/rtl.h` (lines 46–57) via `#include "rtl.def"`. So
   `genrtl.h` (only `gen_rtx_fmt_*` helpers) and `insn-codes.h` (only
   `enum insn_code`) are correct as-is; nothing to regenerate.
3. `target-hooks-def.h` is produced by **`genhooks "Target Hook"`** (not
   genconfig). Built `genhooks` and generated `target-hooks-def.h`,
   `c-family/c-target-hooks-def.h`, `common/common-target-hooks-def.h` (the
   latter two into `gen/c-family/` and `gen/common/` so the quoted includes
   resolve).
4. i386 register-number constants (`AX_REG`…`DI_REG`, `XMM0_REG`) and the
   `UNSPECV_*` values come from `define_constants` in `i386.md` →
   `insn-constants.h` (genconstants). **No header includes `insn-constants.h`**,
   so `gen/tm.h` was edited to `#include "insn-constants.h"` alongside
   `insn-flags.h` (a force-include test confirmed this clears the `DI_REG`
   errors).
5. `i386.c:24677` needs `i386-builtin-types.inc`; generated it from
   `i386-builtin-types.def` via `awk -f i386-builtin-types.awk` (868 lines).
6. The assembler/gas capability macros are **configure-time** values, absent
   from a hand-built config. Added to the smoke `GASDEFS` (x86_64-linux, modern
   gas): `HAVE_COMDAT_GROUP`, `HAVE_GAS_SHF_MERGE`,
   `HAVE_GAS_CFI_SECTIONS_DIRECTIVE`, `HAVE_GAS_HIDDEN`,
   `HAVE_GAS_MAX_SKIP_P2ALIGN=65535`, `HAVE_AS_GOTOFF_IN_DATA`,
   `HAVE_AS_IX86_CMOV_SUN_SYNTAX`, `HAVE_AS_IX86_FFREEP`, `HAVE_AS_IX86_FILDQ`,
   `HAVE_AS_IX86_FILDS`, `HAVE_AS_IX86_REP_LOCK_PREFIX`, `HAVE_AS_TLS`,
   `HAVE_AS_GOTTPLTPCALL`, `HAVE_AS_TLSDIRECT`, `HAVE_AS_CFI_SECTIONS`,
   `HAVE_AS_X86_CMPXCHG16B`.
7. **`TARGET_CPU_DEFAULT` was `""`** in `contrib/gcc/config.h:35`. `i386.c:3148`
   does `cpu_names[TARGET_CPU_DEFAULT]`, which became `cpu_names[""]` →
   "array subscript is not an integer". A real x86 build leaves the macro to
   `i386.h:193`'s `#ifndef` fallback. Changed it to the enum constant
   `TARGET_CPU_DEFAULT_generic`.

**Note:** `i386.c:39128` includes `gt-i386.h` (gengtype output); it exists in the
gen dir and the file linked through. `gengtype` phase 2 still exits rc=1 with
nonblocking warnings but emits usable `gtype-desc.{c,h}` + `gt-*.h`.

**Next:** batch-compile the full `cc1` object list (the `OBJS` middle-end set +
 `i386.o` + `C_OBJS`/`c-family` + `i386-c.o` + `ggc-none.o` + `main.o` +
 `OBJS-libcommon[-target]`), fix any remaining SDK gaps, then add the `cc1`
 build section to `contrib/gcc/Makefile` and link.

### 03:00–03:35 — **MILESTONE: in-OS `cc1` links clean** (18.2 MB x86-64 ELF, 0 undefined refs)

The 36-symbol undefined-reference wall from the third link is fully cleared. `cc1`
now links to a valid `EXEC` ELF (entry + `main` present, `.text` ~7 MB). Fixes landed:

- **Constraint macros (6):** `CONSTRAINT_LEN`, `CONST_OK_FOR_CONSTRAINT_P`,
  `CONST_DOUBLE_OK_FOR_CONSTRAINT_P`, `REG_CLASS_FROM_CONSTRAINT`,
  `EXTRA_ADDRESS_CONSTRAINT`, `EXTRA_MEMORY_CONSTRAINT` are all `#define`s in
  `defaults.h`. The undefined refs were **stale objects** (compiled before the
  force-include took effect). Recompiling `recog`, `ira-conflicts`, `ira-costs`,
  `ira-lives`, `postreload`, `regmove`, `reload1`, `reload`, `stmt` → 0 refs.
- **`targetcm` / `targetm_common`:** compiled `config/default-c.c` → `default-c.o`
  (exports `targetcm`) and `common/config/i386/i386-common.c` → `i386-common.o`
  (exports `targetm_common`). Note: `default-c.c` lives in `gcc/config/`, which
  `compile_one.sh` does not search, so it needed a direct compile.
- **GGC allocs:** `ggc_alloc_cleared_machine_function` / `ggc_alloc_stack_local_entry`
  are called by ~18 targets but defined nowhere (not generated, not in headers).
  Added `gen/shim-ggc-alloc.c` defining both via `ggc_internal_cleared_alloc_stat`.
  `struct machine_function` is complete in `i386.h`; `struct stack_local_entry` is
  file-local to `i386.c` so the shim mirrors its 4 fields (2+2+pad+8+8 = 24 B) to
  size the allocation.
- **Mudflap:** `mudflap_init` is only in `tree-mudflap.o`, which collides with
  `tree-nomudflap.o` on 5 other symbols. Kept `tree-nomudflap.o` and added a no-op
  `mudflap_init` stub to `shim-ggc-alloc.c` (only called under runtime `flag_mudflap`).
- **Host funcs → libiberty.a:** compiled `physmem.c`(physmem_total),
  `getruntime.c`(get_run_time), `getpwd.c`(getpwd), `lrealpath.c`(lrealpath),
  `cp-demint.c`(cplus_demangle_v3_components).
- **libdecnumber bid/ieee → libdecnumber.a:** compiled `bid2dpd_dpd2bid.c`,
  `host-ieee32/64/128.c`.
- **SDK libc gaps:** added `asctime` (macro.c) and `bsearch` (files.c) to
  `sdk/posix.c` + declarations to `sdk/include/{time,stdlib}.h`.
- **hwint log fns (5):** `floor_log2`, `exact_log2`, `ctz_hwi`, `clz_hwi`,
  `ffs_hwi` are `static inline` in `hwint.h` only for `GCC_VERSION >= 3004`, but the
  prebuilt objects reference them as out-of-line symbols. Added `gen/shim-hwint.c`
  with self-contained out-of-line defs (HOST_WIDE_INT=`long`, 64-bit; includes
  `<limits.h>` for `CHAR_BIT`).

`cc1_objs.txt` now 348 entries. Archives extended in place.

**Next:** (1) integrate `cc1` into the in-OS self-host build (stage it to `/work`,
wire a `make test-cc1` target); (2) run it in-OS to compile a trivial `.c` and
confirm it emits runnable assembly; (3) add the `cc1` build section to
`contrib/gcc/Makefile` so the whole chain is reproducible from `make`.

### 06:34–06:48 — **MILESTONE: reproducible `cc1` build from `contrib/gcc/Makefile`**

Completed the "Next (3)" item from 03:35: the whole `cc1` host build now runs
from `make -C ics-os/contrib/gcc cc1` (or `all`) with no manual steps. From a
pristine scratch (`rm -rf /tmp/icsos-gcc`) it builds 349/349 cc1 objects,
4/4 archives (`libcpp`/`libiberty`/`libdecnumber`/`libz`), links the 3
prebuilt math archives, and emits a valid `cc1` (18,180,320 B, `T main`, 0
undefined). Incremental `make cc1` is a correct no-op.

Repo additions (all under `ics-os/contrib/gcc/`, untracked):

- **`gen/`** — 94-file (19 MB) snapshot of the generated headers/sources the
  build needs: 14 `.c` (gtype-desc, insn-*, options, options-save), 78 `.h`,
  `all-tree.def`, `i386-builtin-types.inc`, and the `c-family`/`common`
  target-hooks defs. State files (`gtype.state`, `tmp-gtype.state`) and build
  artifacts were excluded; there is **no** `gen/config.h` so it cannot shadow
  `contrib/gcc/config.h`.
- **`shims/`** — `shim-ggc-alloc.c`, `shim-hwint.c`, `cc1-checksum.c`
  (hand-written stand-in for genchecksum output; provides `executable_checksum`).
- **`cc1-objs.txt`** — the 349-entry object list (each entry already `.o`).
- **`decnuminc/config.h`** — minimal decNumber config (`WORDS_BIGENDIAN 0`);
  `dconfig.h` pulls in `tconfig.h` + this `config.h`.
- **`Makefile`** — rewritten. Builds the 4 libc archives, falls back to
  `$(MAKE) -C <gmp|mpfr|mpc>` for the math archives if missing, compiles the 349
  cc1 objects via a pattern rule (5-candidate source search: `gen/`, `shims/`,
  `gcc/`, `gcc/config/i386/`, `gcc/config/`), and links with
  `--start-group … --end-group -Wl,--no-undefined`.

Difficulties hit and fixed:

- **Double `.o`:** `CC1_OBJS` used `$(patsubst %.c,%.o,…)` on a list that already
  carried `.o`, producing `alias.o.o`. Switched to `$(addprefix $(CC1_OBJDIR)/,…)`.
- **VERDEFS quoting (the real blocker):** `toplev.o` failed with
  `‘ics’ undeclared` / `‘os’ undeclared` from `TARGET_NAME`. Root cause: in a
  make variable expanded onto the recipe command line, `-DTARGET_NAME="…"` has
  its quotes stripped by the single shell pass. `compile_one.sh` never hit this
  because the quotes lived *inside* a bash variable passed via unquoted
  `$CFLAGS` (no re-parsing). Fix: backslash-escape the quotes in the make
  variable (`-DTARGET_NAME=\"x86_64-ics-os\"`) so the shell preserves them.
  Verified with a scratch Makefile that `\"` (not single-quoting) survives.
- **libiberty** needed 2 files beyond the 5 known host funcs: `cp-demangle.c`,
  `safe-ctype.c` (now 48 members).
- **libdecnumber** builds *without* `-fno-builtin`/`-fno-asynchronous` and uses
  the staged `decnuminc/`; **libz** builds *without* `-nostdinc` (its `zconf.h`
  needs `sys/feature_tests.h` + `unistd.h`). `crc32` is in both libiberty and
  libz; link order (libiberty first in the group) resolves it.

**Next:** (1) in-OS validation via QEMU — stage `cc1` to `/work`, wire a
`make test-cc1`, run it in-OS to compile a trivial `.c` and confirm runnable
output (host `./cc1 --version` is meaningless: the SDK uses the ICS-OS
`int 0x30` syscall ABI); (2) optionally make GMP/MPFR/MPC build-from-source
reproducible too (today they are prebuilt `.a` + a fallback rule).

### 07:00–07:16 — **GMP/MPFR/MPC made source-reproducible; GMP default-goal bug fixed**

Per user direction the next step was (2): make the three math libraries
build-from-source reproducible through `contrib/gcc/Makefile` before any QEMU
work. Wiping the three `.a` + `obj/` dirs and the `/tmp/icsos-gcc` stage, then
`make -C gcc -j4 cc1`, rebuilt MPFR and MPC from `references/` source, but
**`libgmp.a` did not build** and the cc1 link failed with
`/usr/bin/ld: cannot find ../../contrib/gmp/libgmp.a`.

Root cause (GMP Makefile): the `dual_rule`/`src_rule` `$(foreach … $(eval …))`
blocks emit the object-file targets *before* the `all: libgmp` line, so the
first target in the file — `obj/logops_n-and_n.o` — becomes make's default
goal. A bare `make -C gmp` built only that one object and exited 0 without
creating the archive. `make -C gmp -n` confirmed it planned just that object;
`make -C gmp -n all` planned all 460 compiles. MPFR/MPC were unaffected because
their `all:` precedes their object rules.

Fix: pinned the default goal in `contrib/gmp/Makefile` with
`.DEFAULT_GOAL := all` (just before the `.PHONY`/`all` block, with a comment
explaining the foreach/eval ordering). Made the gcc overlay's math fallback
rules robust by invoking `$(MAKE) -C <dir> all` explicitly (was a bare
`$(MAKE) -C <dir>`), and added a standalone `mathlibs` target to
`contrib/gcc/Makefile` that regenerates all three archives from source.

Verification (all green):

- Full source rebuild (wiped all three `.a`+`obj/` + cc1 stage, then
  `make -C gcc -j4 cc1`) → exit 0: `libgmp.a` 461 members, `libmpfr.a` 217,
  `libmpc.a` 78 (all from `references/`); `cc1` relinked 18,180,320 B, `T main`,
  **0 undefined** symbols.
- Host functional tests: `GMP_HOST_TEST_PASS`, `MPFR_HOST_TEST_PASS`,
  `MPC_TEST_PASS` (each runs its rebuilt archive on the host).
- `make -C gcc test-gmpmpfr` → `GCC_GMPMPFR_WIRING_OK`.
- `mathlibs` target: deleting only `mpc/libmpc.a` then `make -C gcc mathlibs`
  rebuilt just MPC; `all` still defaults to cc1; incremental `make cc1` is a
  no-op when up to date.

The whole chain is now source-reproducible: `make -C contrib/gcc cc1`
regenerates GMP/MPFR/MPC from `references/` (when a `.a` is missing) and builds
a link-clean `cc1`.

**Next:** in-OS validation via QEMU — stage `cc1` to `/work`, wire a
`make test-cc1`, run it in-OS to compile a trivial `.c` and confirm runnable
output (host `./cc1 --version` is meaningless: the SDK uses the ICS-OS
`int 0x30` syscall ABI).
